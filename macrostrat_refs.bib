  abstract = {The upper allochthonous units of NW Iberian Massif contain an extensive Cambrian magmatism (c. 500 Ma), covering felsic to mafic compositions. The magmatic activity generated large massifs of granitoids and gabbros, with calc-alkaline and tholeiitic compositions respectively. Petrological and geochemical features of these massifs are characteristic of volcanic arc. The plutons intruded siliciclastic sedimentary series deposited in the periphery of the West Africa Craton. U\textendash Pb/Hf isotopic compositions of detrital zircon in the siliciclastic host series, indicate continental arc activity between c. 750 Ma and c. 500 Ma. It was characterized by a large variety of isotopic sources, including from very old continental input, even Archean, to the addition of a significant amount of juvenile mafic material. These isotopic sources experienced an extensive mixing that explains the composition and isotopic features ({$\epsilon$}Hft from - 50 until + 15) of the represented Cambrian plutons. The Cambrian igneous rocks of the upper units of NW Iberia are related to the latest activity of the Avalonian\textendash Cadomian arc. From the Middle Cambrian arc activity in the periphery of Gondwana was replaced by pronounced extension associated with the development of continental rifting, which finally led to separation of the microcontinent Avalonia. Subsequent drifting of Avalonia to the North caused progressive opening one of the main Paleozoic ocean, the Rheic Ocean.},

  abstract = {Cratonic basins form within stable regions of the continental interior and initiate during periods of break-up and dispersal of supercontinental assemblies, when the continental lithosphere may experience tensional stress. We investigate the subsidence of cratonic basins using a 1D forward model of protracted stretching at low strain rates of thick continental lithosphere. At low strain rates, subsidence history departs from the uniform instantaneous model, as supported by calculations of the thermal Pe\textasciiacute clet number. Cooling as a result of upward advection is matched by thermal diffusion, producing a subsidence trajectory with a nearconstant slope and a slight elbow when stretching ceases. The model is used to evaluate the subsidence history of boreholes in cratonic basin-fills. Marked accelerations and decelerations of subsidence, attributed to secondary mechanisms such as the dynamic response to mantle convection, are removed from the backstripped, water-loaded subsidence curves to obtain the `reduced' subsidence. Fits to the reduced curves indicate strain rates of c. 10\`A16 s\`A1, stretching durations of 50 Ma, and stretch factors of as little as 1.1\textendash 1.3, despite the extreme longevity of subsidence. Cratonic basins are therefore part of the rift\textendash drift suite, occupying a portion of the existence field at low stretch factors and low extensional strain rate.},

  abstract = {Low temperature thermochronometry of cratonic regions can illuminate relationships among burial and unroofing patterns, surface subsidence and uplift, and lithosphere\textendash asthenosphere interactions. The Slave craton, initially stabilized by the development of a thick lithospheric mantle root in late Archean time, is an excellent location in which to examine these connections. Although the Slave craton currently lacks Phanerozoic cover, Phanerozoic sedimentary xenoliths entrained in ca. 610 to 45 Ma kimberlites indicate that the region underwent a more dynamic history of burial and unroofing than widely recognized. We report new apatite (U\textendash Th)/He thermochronometry data along a southeast to northwest transect from the interior of the Slave craton into the adjacent Paleoproterozoic Wopmay orogen to resolve the region's depositional and denudational history. Six samples from the western Slave craton and three samples from Wopmay orogen yield mean dates from 296 {$\pm$} 41 Ma to 212 {$\pm$} 39 Ma. Individual apatite dates are broadly uniform over a wide span of apatite [eU], and this pattern can be used to more tightly restrict the spectrum of viable temperature\textendash time paths that can explain the dataset. When coupled with geologic and stratigraphic information, temperature\textendash time simulations of the thermochronometry results suggest complete He loss from the apatites at minimum peak temperatures of \textasciitilde{} 88 \textdegree C in Devonian\textendash Pennsylvanian time, cooling to near-surface conditions by the Early Cretaceous, followed by reheating to {$\leq$} 72 \textdegree C during Cretaceous\textendash Early Tertiary time. Consideration of modern and ancient geotherm constraints implies {$\geq$} 3.3 km of burial during the first Phanerozoic heating phase, with an ancillary phase of reburial in late Mesozoic\textendash Cenozoic time. The uniformity of the apatite (U\textendash Th)/He dates indicates that the rocks encompassed by our {$>$} 250 km-long sample transect experienced similar Phanerozoic thermal histories. Despite the distinctly different lithospheric architecture on either side of the Paleoproterozoic suture between the Slave craton and Wopmay orogen, the region behaved as a single, broadly coherent cratonic unit since at least ca. 250 Ma. The Phanerozoic burial and unroofing patterns across the craton may be a response to far-field convergent activity at the northern and western margins of North America and processes associated with episodic kimberlite emplacement.},

  abstract = {The Cretaceous and Cenozoic fill of the continental margins of southern Africa (SouthEast Atlantic and Agulhas Margins) contains a continuous record of sediment supplied from the South African Plateau (SAP) for the past 134 million years. Estimates of solid sediment volumes deposited offshore were calculated from isopach maps and extrapolated vertical cross-sections derived from a large amount of industrial geophysical data. Solid phase volumes and accumulation rates were calculated for six epochs: Lower Cretaceous (134\textendash 113 Ma), Mid Cretaceous (113\textendash 93.5 Ma), Upper Cretaceous (93.5\textendash 81 and 81\textendash 66 Ma), Palaeogene (66\textendash 25 Ma), Neogene (25\textendash 0 Ma). Our new compilation demonstrates the existence of two periods of elevated flux. The most important one occurs in the late Cretaceous (93.5\textendash 66 Ma) and was synchronous with an acceleration of onshore denudation as shown by thermochronometric data. After a period of extremely low accumulation rate, the second phase of elevated flux started in the Oligocene (\textasciitilde 30\textendash 25 Ma) until present-day. From these observations we suggest that the main phase of uplift of the SAP took place during the Upper Cretaceous. Two mechanisms, namely uplift caused by lithospheric delamination or by dynamic topography caused by the continent moving over the African Superplume, are viable explanations for our observations. The more recent and lower amplitude episode of enhanced accumulation rates is likely to correspond to a second period of uplift, potentially associated with the onset of uplift and extension along the East African Rift System.},

Previously interpreted as a pull-apart basin, the Paradox Basin more closely resembles intraforeland flexural basins such as those that developed between the basement-cored uplifts of the Late Cretaceous{$\pm$}Eocene Laramide orogeny in the western interior USA. The shape, subsidence history, facies architecture, and structural relationships of the Uncompahgre{$\pm$}Paradox system are exemplary of typical `immobile' foreland basin systems. Along the southwest-vergent Uncompahgre thrust, \textasciitilde 5 km of coarse-grained syntectonic Desmoinesian{$\pm$}Wolfcampian (mid-Pennsylvanian to early Permian; \textasciitilde 310{$\pm$}260 Ma) sediments were shed from the Uncompahgre uplift by alluvial fans and reworked by aeolian-modified fluvial megafan deposystems in the proximal Paradox Basin. The coeval rise of an uplift-parallel barrier \textasciitilde 200 km southwest of the Uncompahgre front restricted reflux from the open ocean south and west of the basin, and promoted deposition of thick evaporite-shale and biohermal carbonate facies in the medial and distal submarine parts of the basin, respectively. Nearshore carbonate shoal and terrestrial siliciclastic deposystems overtopped the basin during the late stages of subsidence during the Missourian through Wolfcampian (\textasciitilde 300{$\pm$}260 Ma) as sediment flux outpaced the rate of generation of accommodation space. Reconstruction of an end-Permian two-dimensional basin profile from seismic, borehole, and outcrop data depicts the relationship of these deposystems to the differential accommodation space generated by Pennsylvanian{$\pm$}Permian subsidence, highlighting the similarities between the Paradox basin-fill and that of other ancient and modern foreland basins. Flexural modeling of the restored basin profile indicates that the Paradox Basin can be described by flexural loading of a fully broken continental crust by a model Uncompahgre uplift and accompanying synorogenic sediments. Other thrust-bounded basins of the ARM have similar basin profiles and facies architectures to those of the Paradox Basin, suggesting that many ARM basins may share a flexural geodynamic mechanism. Therefore, plate tectonic models that attempt to explain the development of ARM uplifts need to incorporate a mechanism for the widespread generation of flexural basins.},

This event, the Ross\^Delamerian Orogeny, marks a distinct and rapid shift in the style of deformation, rate of uplift, volume of magmatism and syn-orogenic sedimentation along the entire 4000+ km length of the orogen. The Ross\^Delamerian Orogeny is constrained to have begun at 515 \th{} 5 Ma, an interval that also encompasses the youngest collisional events that lead to the suturing of Gondwana. We propose that these geographically separate events are intimately linked and represent the cause and effect of a major tectonic reorganisation in the motion of the Earth's plates. We suggest the mechanism controlling this Early to Middle Cambrian plate reorganisation was the rapid reduction in relative motion, driven by continental collision, between the final two components of Gondwana. Due to the need to maintain a zero sum for all plate motions, the change in the rate of convergence at this boundary resulted in compensatory changes elsewhere in the global plate circuit. One such change was an increase in the rate and perhaps direction of convergence along the Pacific margin of Gondwana.},

  abstract = {The origin of the Antarctic continent can be traced to a relatively small late Archaean cratonic nucleus centred on the Terre Ad\'elie regions of East Antarctica and the Gawler Craton region of South Australia. From the late Archaean to the present, the evolution of the proto-Antarctic continent was remarkably dynamic with quasicontinuous growth driven by accretionary or collisional events, episodically punctuated by periods of crustal extension and rifting. The evolution of the continent can be broken into seven main steps: (1) late Palaeoproterozoic to middle Mesoproterozoic accretion and collision added crust first to the Antarctic nucleus's eastern margin, then to its western margin. These events resulted in the incorporation of the Antarctic nucleus within a single large continent that included all of Proterozoic Australia, a more cryptic Curnamona\textendash Beardsmore Craton and most probably Laurentia. (2) Rifting in the middle to late Mesoproterozoic separated a block of continental crust of unknown dimensions to form an ocean-facing margin, the western edge of which was defined by the ancestral Darling Fault in Western Australia and its unnamed continuation in Antarctica. (3) Inversion of this margin followed shortly and led to the Grenville aged collision and juxtaposition of proto-Antarctica with the Crohn Craton, a continental block of inferred Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic age that now underlies much of central East Antarctica. The Pinjarra Orogen, exposed along the coast of Western Australia, defines the orogenic belt marking this collision. In Antarctica the continuation of this belt has been imaged in sub-ice geophysical datasets and can be inferred from sparse outcrop data and via the widespread dispersal of syn-tectonic zircons. (4) Tectonic quiescence from the latest Mesoproterozoic to the Cryogenian was the forerunner to Ediacaran rifting that separated Laurentia and the majority of the Curnamona\textendash Beardsmore craton from the amalgam of East Antarctica and Australia. The result was the formation of the ancestral Pacific Ocean. (5) The rifting of Laurentia was mirrored by convergence along the opposing margin of the continent. Convergence ultimately sutured material with Indian and African affinities during a series of Ediacaran and Cambrian events related to the formation of Gondwana. These events added much of the crust that today defines the East Antarctic coastline between longitudes 30\textdegree W and 100\textdegree E. (6) The amalgamation of Gondwana marked a shift in the locus of subduction from between the preGondwana cratons to Gondwana's previously passive Pacific margin. The result was the establishment of the accretionary Terra Australis and Gondwanide orogenies. These were to last from the late Cambrian to the Cretaceous, and together accreted vast sequences of Gondwana derived sediment as well as fragments of older and allochthonous or para-allochthonous continental crust to Gondwana's Pacific margin. (7) The final phases of accretion overlapped with the initiation of extension and somewhat later rifting within Gondwana. Extension started in the late Carboniferous, although continental separation did not begin until the middle Jurassic. Gondwana then fragmented sequentially with Africa\textendash South America, India, Australia and the finally the blocks of New Zealand separating between the middle Jurassic and the late Cretaceous. The late Cretaceous separation of Antarctica and Australia split the original Antarctic nucleus, terminating more than 2.4 billion years of shared evolution. The slightly younger separation of New Zealand formed the modern Antarctic continent.},

The results indicate that tectonic subsidence along the inner edge of the miogeocline was controlled mainly by thermal contraction of heated lithosphere. Comparison of a palinspastically restored cross section of the inner part of the miogeocline with a cross section constructed from a twodimensional stretching model suggests that thinned continental crust was present beneath the inner miogeocline. These results support the passive-margin model that has been proposed for the miogeocline. The extensive transgression onto the craton east of the miogeocline in Cambrian time, however, cannot be explained by subsidence processes operating within a passive margin, and the transgression could be evidence for a eustatic rise of sea level.},

  abstract = {We present new sedimentary flux data confirming that a large pulse of erosion affected the Southern African Plateau in the Late Cretaceous and is likely to be related to a major uplift episode of the plateau. This short phase of erosion (i.e., less than 30 Myr in duration) has commonly been difficult to reconcile with a mantle origin for the plateau anomalous uplift: given its size, the rise of the African superplume is likely to have lasted much longer. Here we demonstrate by using a simple model for fluvial erosion that tilting of the continent as it rides over a wide dynamic topography high cannot only cause rapid uplift of the plateau but also trigger continent-wide drainage reorganization, leading to substantial denudation in a relatively short amount of time. The amplitude and short duration of the sedimentary pulse are best reproduced by assuming a strong erodibility contrast between the Karoo sedimentary and volcanic rocks and the underlying basement. We also present a new compilation of paleoclimate indicators that shows a transition from arid to very humid conditions approximately at the onset of the documented erosional pulse, suggesting that climate may have also played a role in triggering the denudation. The diachronism of the sedimentary flux between the eastern and western margins of the plateau and the temporal and geographic coincidence between the uplift and kimberlite eruptions are, however, better explained by our tilt hypothesis driven by the migration of the continent over a fixed source of mantle upwelling.},

The mechanism of formation of the sequences and their bounding unconformities remain uncertain. Although eustasy probably contributed, it cannot have acted alone in their formation, as testified by syn-depositional faulting and post-depositional tilting of strata. We have developed a three-dimensional stratigraphic model which incorporates vertical motions from dynamic topography, background cratonic subsidence, eustasy, denudation, mixed carbonate and c\&tic deposition, Airy isostasy in response to loading and unloading, and mechanical compaction. The model has been used to test possible contributions of eustasy, epeirogeny and background subsidence to patterns of cratonic strata. The results demonstrate the potential of dynamic topography to account for observed long-wavelength tilting. They also demonstrate the importance of background subsidence on the craton in providing accommodation space to accumulate and preserve the observed thicknesses of stratigraphic sequences.},

Forward modelling of mantle flow in response to a subducting slab predicts amplitudes and distributions of dynamic topography that may occur due to various subducting slab geometries and histories. Plotting calculated dynamic topographies at a point against time produces tectonic subsidence curves. These subsidence curves show features such as evolution from convex to concave shape, amplitudes up to \textasciitilde 2000 m, subsidence rates up to \textasciitilde 220 m Myr-1, and a general decrease in subsidence amplitude away from the subduction zone, over a distance of \textasciitilde 2000 km. On many convergent continental margins, dynamic topography is likely to be superimposed on other subsidence mechanisms. In back-arc basins, subsidence due to dynamic topography should be distinguishable from that due to extensional tectonics based simply on the temporal subsidence evolution expressed in the subsidence curve shapes. In a foreland basin setting, comparing dynamic topography models with forward models of flexural loading suggest the two processes can generate similar temporal subsidence patterns, but that dynamic topography causes subsidence over significantly greater wavelengths. Matches between calculated subsidence due to dynamic topography and backstripped subsidence patterns from Upper Cretaceous strata of the Western Interior Basin, USA, support the hypothesis that a long-wavelength `background subsidence' was caused by dynamic topography.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Paleogeographic reconstructions are important to understand Earth's tectonic evolution, past eustatic and regional sea level change, paleoclimate and ocean circulation, deep Earth resources and to constrain and interpret the dynamic topography predicted by mantle convection models. Global paleogeographic maps have been compiled and published, but they are generally presented as static maps with varying map projections, different time intervals represented by the maps and different plate motion models that underlie the paleogeographic reconstructions. This makes it difficult to convert the maps into a digital form and link them to alternative digital plate tectonic reconstructions. To address this limitation, we develop a workflow to restore global paleogeographic maps to their present-day coordinates and enable them to be linked to a different tectonic reconstruction. We use marine fossil collections from the Paleobiology Database to identify inconsistencies between their indicative paleoenvironments and published paleogeographic maps, and revise the locations of inferred paleo-coastlines that represent the estimated maximum transgression surfaces by resolving these inconsistencies. As a result, the consistency ratio between the paleogeography and the paleoenvironments indicated by the marine fossil collections is increased from an average of 75\,\% to nearly full consistency (100\,\%). The paleogeography in the main regions of North America, South America, Europe and Africa is significantly revised, especially in the Late Carboniferous, Middle Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Late Cretaceous and most of the Cenozoic. The global flooded continental areas since the Early Devonian calculated from the revised paleogeography in this study are generally consistent with results derived from other paleoenvironment and paleo-lithofacies data and with the strontium isotope record in marine carbonates. We also estimate the terrestrial areal change over time associated with transferring reconstruction, filling gaps and modifying the paleogeographic geometries based on the paleobiology test. This indicates that the variation of the underlying plate reconstruction is the main factor that contributes to the terrestrial areal change, and the effect of revising paleogeographic geometries based on paleobiology is secondary.},

  abstract = {Global sea level change can be inferred from sequence stratigraphic and continental flooding data. These methods reconstruct sea level from peri-cratonic and cratonic basins that are assumed to be tectonically stable and sometimes called reference districts, and from spatio-temporal correlations across basins. However, it has been understood that long-wavelength (typically hundreds of km) and low-amplitude ({$<$} 2 km) vertical displacements of the Earth's surface due to mantle flow, namely dynamic topography, can occur in the absence of crustal deformation. Dynamic topography can drive marine inundation or regional emergence of continents and must be taken into consideration for eustasy estimates. Our analysis indicates that the long-term trend in globalscale maximum flooding over the late Paleozoic generally correlates with global sea level curves. The first-order flooding history of North America correlates with some estimates of eustasy. The Paleozoic inundation of South America does not follow long-term sea level variations. The flooding lows during the Early Carboniferous and high during the Late Carboniferous are at odds with estimates of eustasy and can be explained by dynamic uplift and subsidence, respectively. Our dynamic topography models indicate that the Yangtze Platform of South China experienced significant dynamic subsidence during the transition from Permian to Triassic largely due to protoPacific subduction and its northward motion to collide with North China. The reference districts \textendash{} Western New York, Oklahoma and Kansas, and West Texas in North America \textendash{} were to some degree affected by dynamic uplift and subsidence associated with long-lived Panthalassa subduction zones, closure of the Rheic Ocean and largescale upwelling above the African deep-mantle structure during late Paleozoic times. This indicates that some published global sea level curves may include non-eustatic signals such as dynamic uplift or subsidence. The interpretation of stratigraphic data gathered from these reference districts should be treated with caution to estimate global sea level variations.},

Synorogenic clastic sediments mark the initiation of tectonism; they arrived in Nevada from the north or northwest in late Early Mississippian (Osagean). An orogenic highland formed in northern Nevada in late Middle Mississippian (Meramecian), producing a regional angular unconformity and terminating deposition in the Antler foreland basin. Unconformably overlying Upper Mississippian (Chesterian) rocks provide tight age control for the redefined ``Antler orogeny'' sensu stricto. Palinspastic restoration of Sr isotopic data reveals a projecting step in the Laurentian margin in northern Nevada. The Antler orogeny resulted from late Middle Mississippian sinistral-oblique convergence at this step. Continuing oblique convergence produced the subsequent late Paleozoic basins, structures, and unconformities in northern Nevada. The Roberts Mountains allochthon is translated material from farther north emplaced onto the margin. Its basal bounding fault, long mapped as the ``Roberts Mountains thrust,'' is in fact not a single continuous fault, motion on it was not synchronous, and displacement on many fault segments mapped as the Roberts Mountains thrust postdate the late Middle Mississippian. We therefore propose that the term ``Roberts Mountains thrust'' be abandoned. This new paradigm not only explains anomalous characteristics of the Antler orogeny but also illustrates criteria for recognizing oblique convergence at other ancient plate margins.},

Deformation structures in xenoliths are truncated by the granite and along with the granites are assigned to a Cambro-Ordovician orogenic event, herein termed the Bhimphedian Orogeny that can be traced across the Himalaya from Pakistan to the eastern Himalaya and possibly extends west into Afghanistan. We interpret the orogeny as being related to Andean-type orogenic activity on the northern margin of the Indian continent, following Gondwana assembly. The magmatic arc was associated with andesitic and basaltic volcanism and was active from c. 530 to 490 Ma. The arc activity overlaps with, and is succeeded by, regional deformation, crustal melting and S-type granite emplacement that extended to 470 Ma. Orogenic activity was driven by coupling across the plate margin either during on-going subduction or through accretion of microcontinental ribbons, possibly represented by the Lhasa and Qiangtang blocks. It represents the termination of an orogenic cycle, termed the North Indian Orogen that commenced with Neoproterozoic rifting and passive margin development and terminated with the Bhimphedian Orogeny. This was succeeded by a return to passive margin setting along the northern Indian margin of Gondwana which continued until the Cenozoic Himalayan Orogeny.},

  abstract = {The Pacific Ocean formed through Neoproterozoic rifting of Rodinia and despite a long history of plate convergence, this ocean has never subsequently closed. The record of ocean opening through continental rifting and the inception of ocean convergence through the initiation of subduction are preserved in the Neoproterozoic to late Paleozoic Terra Australis Orogen. The orogen had a pre-dispersal length along the Gondwana margin of approximately 18,000 km and was up to 1600 km wide. It incorporates the Tasman, Ross and Tuhua orogens of Australia, Antarctica and New Zealand, respectively, the Cape Basin of Southern Africa, and Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic orogenic elements along the Andean Cordillera of South America. The Terra Australis Orogen can be divided into a series of basement blocks of either continental or oceanic character that can be further subdivided on the basis of pre-orogenic geographic affinity (Laurentian vs. Gondwanan) and proximity to inferred continental margin sequences (peri-Gondwanan vs. intra-oceanic). These divisions reflect initial tectonic setting and provide an insight into the character of the orogen through time. The orogen incorporates elements that are inferred to have lain outboard of both West and East Laurentia within Rodinia. Subduction of the Pacific Ocean was established at, or close to, the Gondwana margin by around 570 Ma and occurred at about the same time as major global plate reorganization associated with final assembly of Gondwana and the opening of the Iapetus Ocean. The termination of the Terra Australis Orogen at around 300\textendash 230 Ma was associated with the assembly of Pangea. It is represented by the Pan-Pacific Gondwanide Orogeny and is marked in east Gondwana by a stepping out in the position of the plate boundary and commencement of the classic late Paleozoic to Mesozoic Gondwanide Orogen. The Pacific has been cited as an example of the declining stage of the Wilson cycle of ocean basins. However, its protracted history of ongoing subduction and the absence of any indication of major continental collisions contrasts with the clear evidence for opening and closing of oceans preserved in the Iapetus/Atlantic and Tethyan realms. The Terra Australis and other orogens that bound the Pacific are accretionary orogens and did not form through the classic Wilson cycle. D 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Transient intraplate sedimentation like the widespread Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway, traditionally considered a flexural foreland basin of the Sevier orogeny, is now generally accepted to be a result of dynamic topography due to the viscous force from mantle downwelling. However, the relative contributions of flexural versus dynamic subsidence are poorly understood. Furthermore, both the detailed subsidence history and the underlying physical mechanisms remain largely unconstrained. Here, we considered both Sevier orogenic loading and three different dynamic topography models that correspond to different geodynamic configurations. We used forward landscape evolution simulations to investigate the surface manifestations of these tectonic scenarios on the regional sedimentation history. We found that surface processes alone are unable to explain Western Interior Seaway sedimentation in a purely orogenic loading system, and that sedimentation increases readily inland with the additional presence of dynamic subsidence. The findings suggest that dynamic subsidence was crucial to Western Interior Seaway formation and that the dominant control on sediment distribution in the Western Interior Seaway transitioned from flexural to dynamic subsidence during 90\textendash 84 Ma, coinciding with the proposed emplacement of the conjugate Shatsky oceanic plateau. Importantly, the sedimentation records require the underlying dynamic subsidence to have been landward migratory, which implies that the underlying mechanism was the regional-scale mantle downwelling induced by the sinking Farallon flat slab underneath the westward-moving North American plate. The simulated landscape evolution also implies that prominent regional-scale Laramide uplift in the western United States should have occurred no earlier than the latest Cretaceous.},

  abstract = {The Earn Group of central Yukon records the transition from a passive to an active margin along western Laurentia in the Late Devonian. Fine-grained clastic rocks and chert of the lower Earn Group contain late Early to Middle Devonian fossils and were deposited in an offshelf environment. The upper Earn Group comprises a mixture of sandstone and conglomerate, fine-grained siliciclastic rocks, and widespread crystal lithic tuff. Zircons from this succession are precisely dated using chemical abrasion isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA\textendash ID\textendash TIMS) methods on igneous (ca. 363 Ma) and detrital (ca. 378\textendash 363 Ma) grains and the ages were confirmed by Frasnian to Famennian fossils. Abrupt, along-strike facies changes within the upper Earn Group of the Glenlyon\textendash Tay River area occur across mapped faults that are inferred to have originated as syndepositional extension faults in the Late Devonian. Occurrences of ca. 363 Ma tuff horizons within all facies of the upper Earn Group provide a temporal correlation across the area. Diorite plutons intrude lower Paleozoic rocks in the area and have U\textendash Pb zircon crystallization dates of ca. 364 Ma. The diorite has calc-alkaline composition consistent with arc magmatism or crustal contamination. The Late Devonian magmatism in the Earn Group is coincident with onset of arc magmatism in the allochthonous Yukon\textendash Tanana terrane, and extension related to rifting and opening of the Slide Mountain ocean in a back-arc setting. Magmatic rocks in the Earn Group of central Yukon thus represent part of a remnant continental arc and back-arc stranded behind the Slide Mountain ocean in the Mississippian.},

A review of geological history, fossil and provenance data for the Caledonian\textendash{} Siberian terranes suggests that they probably occupied an intermediate position between northern Baltica, northeastern Laurentia and Siberia, in proximity to the northern Caledonides, in early Palaeozoic time. Dispersion of these terranes and their westward incursion into eastern Panthalassa are interpreted to result from development of a Caribbean- or Scotia-style subduction system between northern Laurentia and Siberia in mid-Palaeozoic time, termed here the Northwest Passage. Westward propagation of a narrow subduction zone coupled with a global change in plate motion, related to the collision of Gondwana with Laurentia\textendash{} Baltica, are proposed to have led to initiation of subduction along the western passive margin of Laurentia and development of the peri-Laurentian terranes as a set of rifted continental fragments, superimposed arcs and marginal ocean basin(s) in mid- to late Palaeozoic time. Diachronous orogenic activity from Late Silurian in Arctic Canada, to Early Devonian in north Yukon and adjacent Alaska, Middle Devonian in southeastern British Columbia, and Late Devonian\textendash Early Mississippian in the western USA records progressive development of the Northwest Passage and southward propagation of subduction along western Laurentia.},

  abstract = {Mantle flow likely supports up to 2 km of long-wavelength topographic relief over Earth's surface. Although the average of this dynamic support must be zero, a net deflection of the ocean basins can change their volume and induce sea-level change. By calculating dynamic topography using a global mantle flow model, we find that continents preferentially conceal depressed topography associated with mantle downwelling, leading to net seafloor uplift and \textasciitilde 90 {$\pm$} 20 m of positive sea-level offset. Upwelling mantle flow is currently amplifying positive dynamic topography and causing up to 1.0 m/Ma of sea-level rise, depending on mantle viscosity. Continental motions across dynamic topography gradients also affect sea level, but uncertainty over the plate motion reference frame permits sea-level rise or fall by {$\pm$}0.3 m/Ma, depending on net lithosphere rotation. During a complete Wilson cycle, sea level should fall during supercontinent stability and rise during periods of dispersal as mantle flow pushes continents down dynamic topography gradients toward areas of mantle downwelling. We estimate that a maximum of \textasciitilde 1 m/Ma of sea-level rise may have occurred during the most recent continental dispersal. Because this rate is comparable in magnitude to other primary sea-level change mechanisms, dynamic offset of sea level by mantle flow should be considered a potentially significant contributor to long-term sea-level change.},

We use a new numerical plate model in which the thermophysical parameters of the lithosphere vary with temperature according to the results of laboratory experiments, and the ridge temperature structure is consistent with the thickness of the oceanic crust. We first attempt to exclude thickened crust from our data set, and then to exclude swells and downwellings by masking regions of the data that remains that have significant gravity anomalies when there exists a clear regional correlation between intermediate-wavelength gravity and topography. We find that the average variation of depth with age is consistent with conventional half-space models until about 90 Myr. Thereafter, the departure from the half-space cooling curve is more rapid than predicted using simple conductive plate cooling models. The depth\textendash age curves in the Pacific and Atlantic show {$\sim$}250 m of temporary shallowing between the ages of 90\textendash 130 Myr, a result consistent with the outcome of experiments on the initiation of small-scale boundary layer convection. The results do not change significantly if the estimated component of the gravity arising from plate cooling is subtracted prior to calculation of the correlation between gravity and topography. A 90-km-thick conductive plate is nevertheless a reasonable model for the average temperature structure of the oldest part of the Pacific ocean lithosphere. In the Pacific, the broad topographic undulations associated with the Line Island Swell, the Hawaiian Swell and surrounding basins have correlated gravity anomalies and an admittance of approximately 30 mGal km-1 and are likely to result from convective circulation in the upper mantle. In the Northeast Atlantic, the intermediate-wavelength admittance over the Cape Verde swell is similar; in the Northwest Atlantic over the Bermuda Swell it is slightly larger but not as well constrained.},

Some of these depositional sequence boundaries can be correlated with previously recognized regional unconformities, but other correlations are ambiguous, and some of these sequence boundaries are not recognized in previous studies. The strata preserve 18 facies associations in carbonate ramp, wave-dominated siliciclastic shelf, siliciclastic tidal coast, and mixed evaporite-siliciclastic desert systems. The widespread extent of these depositional sequences indicates their potential utility as a correlation framework for the Jurassic of the western interior. Facies in these sequences show a consistent northwestward trend toward more open marine conditions, consistent with previous interpretations of depositional dip. Although the thicknesses of depositional sequences likewise tend to thicken northwestward, they also show marked changes both laterally and vertically, suggesting patterns of accommodation more complicated than a simple northwestward increase. The regional extent of the depositional sequences points to a eustatic origin, but the thickness and distribution of individual sequences were substantially modified by dynamic topography, which caused the great width of this basin across Wyoming and Montana compared with regions to the north and south. These strata record a gradual climatic shift from predominantly arid environments to semiarid, winter-wet conditions, which is reflected by a gradual change from a carbonate-evaporite system to a siliciclastic system. This shift was promoted by northward drift of the region out of the global subtropical arid belt and filling of the foreland basin by the northward-prograding Morrison coastal plain.},

  abstract = {Geochronological, structural, and sedimentological data provide the basis for a regional synthesis of the evolution of the Cordilleran retroarc thrust belt and foreland basin system in the western U.S.A. In this region, the Cordilleran orogenic belt became tectonically consolidated during Late Jurassic time (ϳ155 Ma) with the closure of marginal oceanic basins and accretion of fringing arcs along the western edge of the North American plate. Over the ensuing 100 Myr, contractile deformation propagated approximately 1000 kilometers eastward, culminating in the formation of the Laramide Rocky Mountain ranges. At the peak of its development, the retroarc side of the Cordillera was divided into five tectonomorphic zones, including from west to east the Luning-Fencemaker thrust belt; the central Nevada (or Eureka) thrust belt; a high-elevation plateau (the ``Nevadaplano''); the topographically rugged Sevier fold-thrust belt; and the Laramide zone of intraforeland basement uplifts and basins. Mid-crustal rocks beneath the Nevadaplano experienced high-grade metamorphism and shortening during Late Jurassic and mid- to Late Cretaceous time, and the locus of major, upper crustal thrust faulting migrated sporadically eastward. By Late Cretaceous time, the middle crust beneath the Nevadaplano was experiencing decompression and cooling, perhaps in response to large-magnitude ductile extension and isostatic exhumation, concurrent with ongoing thrusting in the frontal Sevier belt. The tectonic history of the Sevier belt was remarkably consistent along strike of the orogenic belt, with emplacement of regional-scale Proterozoic and Paleozoic megathrust sheets during Early Cretaceous time and multiple, more closely spaced, Paleozoic and Mesozoic thrust sheets during Late Cretaceous\textendash Paleocene time. Coeval with emplacement of the frontal thrust sheets, large structural culminations in ArcheanProterozoic crystalline basement developed along the basement step formed by Neoproterozoic rifting. A complex foreland basin system evolved in concert with the orogenic wedge. During its early and late history (ϳ155 - 110 Ma and ϳ70 - 55 Ma) the basin was dominated by nonmarine deposition, whereas marine waters inundated the basin during its midlife (ϳ110 - 70 Ma). Late Jurassic basin development was controlled by both flexural and dynamic subsidence. From Early Cretaceous through early Late Cretaceous time the basin was dominated by flexural subsidence. From Late Cretaceous to mid-Cenozoic time the basin was increasingly partitioned by basement-involved Laramide structures. Linkages between Late Jurassic and Late Cretaceous Cordilleran arcmagmatism and westward underthrusting of North American continental lithosphere beneath the arc are not plainly demonstrable from the geological record in the Cordilleran thrust belt. A significant lag-time (ϳ20 Myr) between shortening and coeval underthrusting, on the one hand, and generation of arc melts, on the other, is required for any linkage to exist. However, inferred Late Jurassic lithospheric delamination may have provided a necessary precondition to allow relatively rapid Early Cretaceous continental underthrusting, which in turn could have catalyzed the Late Cretaceous arc flare-up.},

The Neoproterozoic Borborema Province presents direct linkage to several orogenic belts along western Gondwana, but its crustal evolution is contentious resulting in a range of geological models. In the region, exotic terranes that might have been docked via thrust- and strike slip structures preserve pre-Gondwana events that provide glimpses for the evolution of orogenic systems more generally. A total of 201 Sm\textendash Nd analysis of the Archean-Paleoproterozoic Alto Moxoto\textasciiacute{} Terrane, central Borborema Province reveals source ages in granitic, mafic and metasedimentary rocks that are mostly Paleoarchean to early Paleoproterozoic, which contrast with the adjacent terranes. The successive juvenile inputs and crustal reworking from Neoarchean (ca. 2.6 Ga) to mid-Paleoproterozoic (ca. 2.1 Ga) diverge with the early to late Neoproterozoic dominant crust of the neighboring blocks. 3D geophysical modelling highlights the unique signature of the Alto Moxoto\textasciiacute{} Terrane compared to these blocks, including: i) K-poor and Th-rich crust and ii) higher gravity gradients when compared with the bordering lithospheric record, both in gamma-spectrometric and gravimetric maps. Moreover, promi\- nent magnetic anomalies in all magnetometric maps coincide with the major shear zones, including previously proposed terrane boundaries, suggesting that they might represent cryptic or unmapped suture zones. The iso\- topic and geophysical data are consistent with derivation of the Alto Moxoto\textasciiacute{} Terrane from older crustal blocks such as the Sa\texttildelow o Francisco and Congo cratons and provide a model to the understanding of the accretionary evolution of western Gondwana.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The origin and displacement history of terranes emplaced along the northern margin of North America remain contentious. One of these terranes is the North Slope subterrane of the Arctic Alaska-Chukotka microplate, which is separated from the northwestern margin of Laurentia (Yukon block) by the Porcupine Shear Zone of Alaska and Yukon. Here, we present new field observations, geological mapping, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, and sedimentary/igneous geochemistry to elucidate the stratigraphic architecture of deformed pre-Mississippian rocks exposed within the Porcupine Shear Zone, which we distinguish herein as the newly defined Ch'oodeenj\`ik succession. The oldest rocks in the Ch'oodeenj\`ik succession consist of siliciclastic strata of the Lahchah and Sunaghun formations (new names), which yield detrital zircon U-Pb age populations of ca. 1050-1250, 1350-1450, 1600-1650, and 2500-2800\,Ma (n\,=800). This succession is overlain by chert-bearing dolostone and limestone of the Caribou Bar formation (new name) that contains vase-shaped microfossils and yields carbonate carbon ({$\delta$}13Ccarb) and strontium (87Sr/86Sr) isotopic data that range from ca. -3\textperthousand{} to +3\textperthousand{} and 0.70636 to 0.70714, respectively. These data suggest that Lahchah, Sunaghun, and Caribou Bar formations are late Tonian in age. These Neoproterozoic rocks are intruded by Late Devonian (Frasnian-Famennian) felsic plutons and mafic dikes, one of which yielded a sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe-reverse geometry (SHRIMP-RG) U-Pb age of 380\,{$\pm$}\,4\,Ma. Neoproterozoic strata of the Ch'oodeenj\`ik succession are also unconformably overlain by Upper Devonian-Carboniferous (?) siliciclastic rocks of the Darcy Creek formation (new name), which yields detrital zircon populations of ca. 365\textendash 385, 420-470 and 625-835\,Ma, in addition to Proterozoic age populations similar to the underlying Tonian strata. Together, these new stratigraphic, geochronological, geochemical, and micropaleontological data indicate that pre-Mississippian rocks exposed within the Porcupine Shear Zone most likely represent a peri-Laurentian crustal fragment that differs from the adjacent Yukon block and North Slope subterrane; thus, the Porcupine Shear Zone represents a fundamental tectonic boundary separating autochthonous Laurentia from various accreted peri-Laurentian crustal fragments.},

  abstract = {The Great Unconformity marks a major gap in the continental geological record, separating Precambrian basement from Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks. However, the timing, magnitude, spatial heterogeneity, and causes of the erosional event(s) and/or depositional hiatus that lead to its development are unknown. We present field relationships from the 1.07-Ga Pikes Peak batholith in Colorado that constrain the position of Cryogenian and Cambrian paleosurfaces below the Great Unconformity. Tavakaiv sandstone injectites with an age of {$\geq$}676 {$\pm$} 26 Ma cut Pikes Peak granite. Injection of quartzose sediment in bulbous bodies indicates near-surface conditions during emplacement. Fractured, weathered wall rock around Tavakaiv bodies and intensely altered basement fragments within unweathered injectites imply still earlier regolith development. These observations provide evidence that the granite was exhumed and resided at the surface prior to sand injection, likely before the 717-Ma Sturtian glaciation for the climate appropriate for regolith formation over an extensive region of the paleolandscape. The 510-Ma Sawatch sandstone directly overlies Tavakaiv-injected Pikes granite and drapes over core stones in Pikes regolith, consistent with limited erosion between 717 and 510 Ma. Zircon (U-Th)/He dates for basement below the Great Unconformity are 975 to 46 Ma and are consistent with exhumation by 717 Ma. Our results provide evidence that most erosion below the Great Unconformity in Colorado occurred before the first Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth and therefore cannot be a product of glacial erosion. We propose that multiple Great Unconformities developed diachronously and represent regional tectonic features rather than a synchronous global phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Apatites from four pairs of samples of Precambrian basement from the western Canadian shield were analyzed by (U\textendash Th)/He thermochronometry to test for the influence of radiation damage on apatite (U\textendash Th)/ He dates in this cratonic region. Recent studies have demonstrated that the accumulation of radiation damage increases the apatite He retentivity, so that apatites with a span of effective U concentrations, eU, that experienced the same thermal history may be characterized by a range of closure temperatures. In this investigation, each sample pair consisted of a mafic dike cross-cutting felsic gneisses from a single outcrop or nearby outcrops that contained apatites with a span of eU. The apatites yielded (U\textendash Th)/He dates from 846 to 123 Ma, and were positively correlated with eU within each sample pair. These results can be explained using a model that tracks the evolution of He mobility in response to the accumulation of radiation damage. When coupled with regional geological constraints, the data appear to require partial to complete He loss due to burial and reheating in Phanerozoic time. New apatite fission- track dates and length data were obtained for five of these samples. The apatite fission- track dates are Proterozoic regardless of apatite eU. Thermal history simulations indicate that the apatite fission-track data are compatible with the (U\textendash Th)/He results, although the thermal histories are not identical in detail and the fission-track results alone do not require Phanerozoic heating. Together the data are consistent with burial of this region by {$\geq$}1 km of Phanerozoic strata that were subsequently denuded, thus pointing toward significant Phanerozoic deposition in the North American cratonic interior hundreds of kilometers east of where previously documented. The results suggest that exploiting radiation damage control on apatite (U\textendash Th)/He dates through investigation of surface sample apatites with a span of closure temperatures can impose tighter restrictions on thermal histories in low relief cratonic landscapes than was previously possible.},

  abstract = {The Antarctic Ross and the Australian Delamerian orogenies are the consequence of stress transfer to the outboard trailing edge of the newly assembled Gondwana supercontinent. This tectonic reorganization occurred in the Early to Middle Cambrian on completion of Pan-African deformation and subduction along the sutures between eastern and western Gondwanan continental fragments. Before this, Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian rocks in eastern Australia were formed in a passive margin and record dispersion of Rodinia with consequent opening of the protoPacific. Our new U-Pb and Rb-Sr geochronology shows that in the South Australian (Adelaide Fold Belt) domain of the Delamerian Orogen, contractional orogenesis commenced at 514 ע 3 Ma and persisted for {$\sim$}24 m.yr. until 490 ע 3 Ma, terminated by rapid uplift, cooling, and extension in association with posttectonic magmatism. Integration of new and published U-Pb and 40Ar-39Ar geochronology from the entire Ross-Delamerian belt shows that although both the Delamerian and Ross have a synchronous late magmatic and terminal cooling history, the Ross commenced its convergent orogenic history at {$\sim$}540 Ma. This was 25 m.yr. before Delamerian deformation began. During the Early Cambrian, eastern Australia was still in a state of extension (or transtension), with opening of the Kanmantoo Basin and associated anorogenic, largely mafic magmatism. This basin received sediment from the already exposed Ross Orogen to the south. The simultaneous first occurrence of strain fabrics and subduction-related magmatism (including boninite, granite, and andesite lavas) at {$\sim$}514 Ma in New Zealand, Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, and Tasmania implies that the Delamerian Orogeny was driven by ridge-push forces transmitted on the initiation of westward-dipping subduction. Subsequent eastward slab rollback at 490 Ma may have occurred when the new slab had reached the transition zone at 650-km depth, resulting in upper plate extension and anorogenic Basin and Range\textendash style magmatism in South Australia and Tasmania (Mount Read belt). The delayed onset of subduction in the Australian sector of the margin implies that westward motion of the Australian portion of eastern Gondwana continued to be accommodated during the late Early Cambrian by subduction or deformation along either the Mozambique Suture or at the northern end of the South Prince Charles Mountains\textendash Prydz Bay suture.},

  abstract = {The Arabian Plate has experienced a complex tectonic history while also being widely influenced by eustatic sea-level changes. These diastrophic events either affected changes in the rate and/or location of subsidence that in turn led to the creation of significant new sedimentary accommodation, or caused major erosional hiatuses. As a result, both eustasy and tectonics have played important roles in the development of sedimentary sequences and in determining the locus and characteristics of reservoir, source and seal facies on the Arabian Platform. Here, we present a synthesis (Cycle Chart) of the regional sea-level fluctuations affecting the Platform that is based on Phanerozoic epi- and peri-Platform sequence-stratigraphic data. Information used for the synthesis includes sections from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Greater Gulf area, Oman and Yemen. The regional Cycle Chart incorporates interpreted sedimentary onlap patterns on the margins of the Arabian Platform, as well as models of regional sea-level fluctuations that controlled these patterns. These are compared to eustatic data that represents the `global-mean' models of sea-level changes, largely at second-order cycle level for the Paleozoic and third-order cycle level for the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. The comparisons reveal that Phanerozoic sediment accumulation patterns on the Platform were broadly controlled by eustasy, with a strong overprint of tectonics for several long intervals. During periods of tectonic quiescence, however, correlations with the eustatic events improve significantly. Thus, for example, during the Cambrian through early Silurian and mid Jurassic through early Paleogene intervals eustasy may have been the significant controlling factor for sedimentary patterns when long-term trends in both regional and global sea-level curves show similarities.},

We reconstructed a history of sea-level fluctuations for the entire Paleozoic by using stratigraphic sections from pericratonic and cratonic basins. Evaluation of the timing and amplitude of individual sea-level events reveals that the magnitude of change is the most problematic to estimate accurately. The long-term sea level shows a gradual rise through the Cambrian, reaching a zenith in the Late Ordovician, then a short-lived but prominent withdrawal in response to Hirnantian glaciation. Subsequent but decreasingly substantial eustatic highs occurred in the mid-Silurian, near the Middle/Late Devonian boundary, and in the latest Carboniferous. Eustatic lows are recorded in the early Devonian, near the Mississippian/Pennsylvanian boundary, and in the Late Permian. One hundred and seventy-two eustatic events are documented for the Paleozoic, varying in magnitude from a few tens of meters to {$\sim$}125 meters.},

  abstract = {Eurasia has largely grown to its present enormous size through episodic addition of crustal blocks by recurring birth and demise of oceans such as Paleotethys and Neotethys. Excluding the Kopet Dagh Mountains in the northeast, crystalline basement rocks of various dimensions are exposed in all continental tectonic zones of Iran. These rocks have traditionally been viewed as continental fragments with Gondwanan affinity and summarily been assigned Precambrian or younger ages, despite the fact that evidence from isotopic dating has largely been lacking. This study presents new ion microprobe and thermal-ionization zircon U-Pb geochronological data from granitoids and orthogneisses from several locations in central Iran and the Sanandaj\textendash Sirjan structural zones to determine crystallization ages and investigate the origin and continental affinity of these various crustal fragments. The resulting U-Pb crystallization ages for the granites and orthogneisses range from late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian, matching the mostly juvenile Arabian\textendash Nubian shield and Peri-Gondwanan terranes constructed after the main phase of Pan-African orogenesis. TIMS analyses of zircons with inherited cores from western Iran suggest that the Neoproterozoic crust of Iran might not be entirely juvenile, pointing to the potential presence of inherited older Proterozoic components as is common in the eastern Arabian shield. More importantly, the new zircon U-Pb crystallization ages unequivocally demonstrate that crystalline basement underlying the Sanandaj\textendash Sirjan zone, central Iran, and the Alborz Mountains is composed of continental fragments with Gondwanan affiliation, characterized by wide spread late Neoproterozoic subduction-related magmatism. The exposure of these late Neoproterozoic\textendash Early Cambrian basement rocks in the Iranian regions north of the Zagros is structurally controlled and linked to both large-scale crustal extension and exhumation during Mesozoic and Tertiary time as well as Tertiary collisional tectonics associated with the closure of Neotethys.},

Evolutionary divergence between the northern and southern segments of the orogen started in the Late Ordovician to Silurian with staggered accretion of the first peri-Gondwanan elements to reach the Laurentia margin, Carolinia in the south and Ganderia in the north. Divergence was amplified during the Silurian, specifically with respect to the nature of the Laurentian margin and the history of accretion. During this time frame, the northern margin was convergent, whereas the amagmatic southern margin may well have been a transform boundary. In terms of accretion, the Late Silurian\textendash Early Devonian docking of Avalonia was restricted to the northern segment, whereas the southern Appalachians appear to have been largely quiescent during this interval. The evolutionary paths of the two segments of the margin converge on a common history in the Late Devonian during the Famennian event; we suggest that this tectonism was related to the initial marginwide interaction of Laurentia with the periGondwanan blocks of Meguma and Suwanee, providing a uniform tectonic template for margin evolution. The Laurentian-Gondwanan collision is marked by second-order divergences in history. Specifically, during the Carboniferous, the southern segment records a larger component of shortening than the northern Appalachians.},

  abstract = {In the Eastern Cordillera of Peru, observations related to the accretion of the Arequipa Terrane to the Amazon craton are scarce and reactivation of sutures in a backarc basin may make interpretation more difficult. CambroOrdovician backarc successions located in proximity to a proposed suture in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru were investigated at Umachiri and Ollantaytambo in order to disentangle the early Paleozoic tectonic history of the Arequipa Terrane. At Umachiri, newly identified fossil assemblages in the upper Cambrian Llallahue Formation (Fm) and in the Lower to Middle Ordovician Umachiri Fm constrain the age of these successions and allow correlation of these strata throughout the Central Andes. Using U\textendash Pb geochronology on zircon, we establish that the Ollantaytambo Fm is an upper Carboniferous succession and that the Umachiri Fm instead correlates with the Lower to Middle Ordovician Ver\'onica and San Jos\'e formations, which form the base of a backarc succession in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru that extended into northwestern Argentina. Detrital zircons from the Umachiri Fm display age signatures characteristic of Arequipa basement and contain a prominent 540\textendash 510 Ma peak. Precise dating and trace element analysis yielded 539 Ma arc-derived and 522\textendash 510 Ma mantle-derived zircons. We infer that a Cambrian backarc system related to deposition of the lower Furongian (\textasciitilde 494 Ma) Llallahue Fm developed following \textasciitilde{} 540 Ma Pampean arc magmatism. Closure of the backarc in late Cambrian to Early Ordovician time resulted in regional deformation, uplift, and erosion followed by renewed backarc subsidence in the Ordovician Period. In summary, our results support a new tectonic model of late Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian Pampean collision of an exotic Arequipa Terrane with Amazonia, opening and closing of a Cambrian backarc basin, the presence of parallel Ordovician continental arcs associated with Famatinian subduction, and the opening of an Ordovician\textendash Devonian backarc basin.},

  abstract = {The sedimentary rock reservoir both records and influences changes in Earth's surface environment. Geoscientists extract data from the rock record to constrain long-term environmental, climatic and biological evolution, with the understanding that geological processes of erosion and rock destruction may have overprinted some aspects of their results. It has also long been recognized that changes in the mass and chemical composition of buried sediments, operating in conjunction with biologically catalyzed reactions, exert a first-order control on Earth surface conditions on geologic timescales. Thus, the construction and destruction of the rock record has the potential to influence both how Earth and life history are sampled, and drive long-term trends in surface conditions that otherwise are difficult to affect. However, directly testing what the dominant process signal in the sedimentary record is \textemdash{} rock construction or destruction \textemdash{} has rarely been undertaken, primarily due to the difficulty of assembling data on the mass and age of rocks in Earth's crust. Here, we present results on the chronological age and general properties of rocks and sediments in the Macrostrat geospatial database (https://macrostrat.org). Empirical patterns in surviving rock quantity as a function of age are indicative of both continual cycling (gross sedimentation) and long-term sediment accumulation (net sedimentation). Temporal variation in the net sedimentary reservoir was driven by major changes in the ability of continental crust to accommodate sediments. The implied history of episodic growth of sediment mass on continental crust has many attendant implications for the drivers of long-term biogeochemical evolution of Earth and life.},

  abstract = {Permo-Triassic granitoids (PTGs) (284\textendash 224 Ma) crop out in Sierra Los Tanques (SLT) and surrounding areas in NW Sonora, Mexico. Based on mineralogical and geochemical characteristics, the PTGs are subdivided into three main suites: melanocratic (MS), leucocratic (LS) and pegmatitic-aplitic (PAS) suites. MS has I-type signatures (mostly metaluminous: biotite and hornblende), while LS is weakly peraluminous with biotite, muscovite, and garnet. PAS is composed of garnet-bearing pegmatite-aplite dikes of Permo-Triassic age. MS is slightly older than LS based upon field relations and age dating. PAS cut both granitoid suites and local Paleoproterozoic banded gneisses. PTGs are petrologically and geochemically classified as granodiorites, granites, and quartz monzonites, with medium-to high-K calc-alkaline affinity, and volcanic-arc granite (VAG) signatures. The enrichment in LILE (such as K, Rb, Ba, Sr, and Pb) and LREE over HFSE and HREE, respectively, together with negative Nb, Ta, P, and Ti anomalies, suggest derivation from a crustal source in a continental arc setting. Trace-element ratios of Ba/Ta{$\gg$}1000, Th/Yb {$>$} 1, and Th/Ta{$>$}6\textendash 20 also support a setting in an active continental margin. All these geochemical features imply that crustal assimilation did play a major role in magma genesis. Crustal contami\- nation is supported by field evidence, including xenoliths, stoped blocks, and roof pendants of Proterozoic basement rocks (Yavapai-type? crust). We propose that the PTGs from NW Sonora formed in a continental arc setting likely derived from the heat-fluxed melting of crustal material induced by mafic (basaltic?) underplating, thus the PTGs record the initiation of subduction and the generation of the early magmas in the nascent Late Paleozoic Cordilleran arc in SW Laurentia.},

  abstract = {Elevated topography is evident across the continental margins of the Atlantic. The Cumberland Peninsula, Baffin Island, formed as the result of rifting along the Labrador\textendash Baffin margins in the late Mesozoic and is dominated by low-relief high-elevation topography. Apatite fission-track (AFT) analysis of the landscape previously concluded that the area has experienced a differential protracted cooling regime since the Devonian; however, defined periods of cooling and the direct causes of exhumation were unresolved. This work combines the original AFT data with 98 apatite new (U\textendash Th)/He (AHe) ages from 16 samples and applies the newly developed `broken crystals' technique to provide a greater number of thermal constraints for thermal history modelling to better constrain the topographic evolution. The spatial distribution of AFT and AHe ages implies that exhumation has been significant toward the SE (Labrador) coastline, and results of thermal modelling outline three notable periods of cooling: in the pre-rift stage (460\textendash 200 Ma), from synrift stage to present (120\textendash 0 Ma) and within the post-rift stage (30\textendash 0 Ma). Pre-rift cooling is interpreted as the result of exhumation of Laurentia and synrift cooling as the result of riftflank uplift to the SE and differential erosion of landscape, whereas the final post-rift period is probably an artefact of the modelling process. These results suggest that the source of the Cumberland Peninsula's modern-day elevated topography is uplift during rifting in the Cretaceous and the isostatic compensation following continuous Mesozoic and Cenozoic differential erosion. This work highlights how interaction of rift tectonics and isostasy can be the principal source for modern elevated continental margins, and also provides insight into the pre-rift exhumational history of central Laurentia.},

U-Pb zircon SIMS, TIMS, and evaporation data provide robust temporal control on depositional, volcanic, and intrusive events. Nd, Sr, O and, increasingly, Hf isotopic studies provide insights into magma sources and constraints on crustal recycling. Apart from well-established exceptions where Paleoproterozoic and Archean rocks intercalated in the ANS underwent Neoproterozoic reworking, the data elegantly confirm the Neoproterozoic age and juvenile character of the bulk of the ANS. The geochronologic and isotopic data reveal that some ANS sedimentary, volcanic, and igneous rocks contain pre-Neoproterozoic material as xenocrysts and possible glaciogenic clasts, but give no evidence that the ANS is otherwise underlain by any extensive tracts of older crust. Together with structural mapping, the expanding dataset confirms ANS boundaries where long-inferred in the west and suggests the placement of hitherto uncertain boundaries elsewhere. The suggested boundaries imply that the ANS is of a somewhat smaller size than considered in published discussions, which in turn impacts assessment of Neoproterozoic crustal growth rate. The Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) is an accretionary orogen at the northern end (present-day coordinates) of the East African Orogen. It is one of the largest expanses of mantle-derived, juvenile Neoproterozoic crust on Earth, underlying an area of \textasciitilde 2.7 x 106 km2. Its western boundary is a contact with pre-Neoproterozoic crust belonging to the Saharan Metacraton and Congo-Tanzania Craton. Farther south, the ANS is in contact with the Congo-Tanzania Craton and Mozambique Belt. A southeastern ANS margin is recognized as a contact with pre-Neoproterozoic gneiss belonging to a crustal block referred to as Azania. An eastern ANS margin, long a topic of debate, is suspected beneath Phanerozoic cover in central Arabia, and a northwestern margin with late Mesoproterozoic crust is suspected in Sinai.},

We combined these precise MDAs with biostratigraphy of trilobite biozones in the Tonto Group. The Tapeats Sandstone is ca. 508\textendash 507\hspace{0.25em}Ma; the Bright Angel Formation contains Olenellus, Glossopleura, and Ehmaniella biozones and is ca. 507\textendash 502\hspace{0.25em}Ma; and the Muav Formation contains Bolaspidella and Cedaria biozones and is ca. 502\textendash 499\hspace{0.25em}Ma.

After noting a moderate match, we modified the positions of the coastlines and conti\- nental margins of these topographic models to reflect times of maximum transgression. Using the updated paleogeographic maps, we outline the changes of land and shallow marine areas over time and suggest ways they can be used for further investigations of our planet's history.},

At least for the first \textasciitilde 70 Myr, the age progression of seafloor depth is known to follow the prediction of half-space cooling, and the subsidence rate is commonly believed to be \textasciitilde{} 350 m Ma-1/2. Here we show that, based on a new statistical analysis of global bathymetry, the average subsidence rate of normal oceanic lithosphere is likely to be \textasciitilde{} 320 m Ma-1/2, i.e., \textasciitilde{} 10\% lower than the conventional value. We define the `normal' seafloor as regions uncorrelated with anomalous crust such as hotspots and oceanic plateaus, but the lower subsidence rate appears to be a stable estimate, not depending on how exactly we define the normal seafloor. This low subsidence rate can still be explained by half-space cooling with realistic mantle properties, if the effective thermal expansivity of a viscoelastic mantle is taken into account. In light of a revised model of half-space cooling, the normal seafloor unperturbed by the emplacement of anomalous crust exists for all ages, and the so-called seafloor flattening seems to be mostly caused by hotspots and oceanic plateaus.},

  abstract = {The formation and destruction of supercontinents requires prolonged convergent tectonics between particular plates, followed by intra-continental extension during subsequent breakup stages. A specific feature of the Late Paleozoic supercontinent Pangea is the prolonged and diachronous formation of the collisional belts of the Rheic suture zone coeval with recurrent continental breakup and subsequent formation of the mid-ocean ridge systems of the Paleo- and Neo-Tethys oceans at the Devonian and Permian margins of the Gondwana plate, respectively. To decide whether these processes are causally related or not, it is necessary to accurately reconstruct the plate motion of Gondwana relative to Laurussia. Here we propose that the strain pattern preserved in the continental crust can be used for the reconstruction of ancient plate kinematics. We present Euler pole locations for the three fundamental stages of the Late Paleozoic assembly of Pangea and closure of the Rheic Ocean: (I) Early Devonian (ca. 400 Ma) collisional tectonics affected Gondwana at the Armorican Spur north of western Africa and at the promontory of the South China block/Australia of eastern Gondwana, resulting in the Variscan and the Qinling orogenies, respectively. The Euler pole of the rotational axis between Gondwana and Laurussia is positioned east of Gondwana close to Australia. (II) Continued subduction of the western Rheic Ocean initiates the clockwise rotation of Gondwana that is responsible for the separation of the South China block from Gondwana and the opening of Paleo-Tethys during the Late Devonian. The position of the rotational axis north of Africa reveals a shift of the Euler pole to the west. (III) The terminal closure of the Rheic Ocean resulted in the final tectonics of the Alleghanides, the Mauritanides and the Ouachita\textendash Sonora\textendash Marathon belt, occurred after the cessation of the Variscan orogeny in Central Europe, and is coeval with the formation of the Central European Extensional Province and the opening of Neo-Tethys at ca. 300 Ma. The Euler pole for the final closure of the Rheic Ocean is positioned near Oslo (Laurussia). Thus, the concomitant formation of convergent and divergent plate boundaries during the assembly of Pangea is due to the relocation of the particular rotational axis. From a geodynamic point of view, coupled collisional (western Pangea) and extensional tectonics (eastern Pangea) due to plate tectonic reorganization is fully explained by slab pull and ridge push forces.},

  abstract = {The Variscides of Europe and N-Africa are the result of the convergence of the plates of Gondwana and Laurussia in the Paleozoic. This orogen is characterized by the juxtaposition of blocks of continental crust that are little affected by the Variscan orogeny. These low strain domains principally consist of Neoproterozoic/Cambrian Cadomian basement overlain by volcano-sedimentary successions of an extended peri-Gondwana shelf. These Cadomian blocks are separated by high strain zones containing the record of subduction-related processes. Traditionally the high strain zones are interpreted as sutures between one or more postulated lithospheric microplates sandwiched between the two major plates. Paleobio-geographic constraints in combination with geochemical and isotopic fingerprints of the protoliths, however, imply that the Variscides are the result of the exclusive interaction of the two plates of Gondwana and Laurussia. Here we explain the Variscan orogen in a two plate scenario, reasoning that the complexity of the Variscan orogen (multitude of high-grade metamorphic belts, compositional diversity of coeval magmatism, and arrangement of foreland basins) is the result of the distribution of crustal domains of contrasting rheological properties. Post-Cadomian rifting along the Cadomian\textendash Avalonian belt, which culminated in the opening of the Rheic Ocean, resulted in vast coeval intracontinental extension and the formation of extended peri-Gondwana shelf areas, namely the Avalonian shelf and the Armorican Spur to the north and south of the evolving Rheic Ocean, respectively. Both shelf areas affected by heterogeneous extension consist of stable continental blocks separated by zones of thinner continental crust. During Variscan collisional tectonics the continental blocks behave as unsubductable crust, whereas the thinner continental crust was subductable and came to constitute the high strain domains of the orogen. The variable interplay between both crustal types in space and time is seen as the principal cause for the observed sequence of orogenic processes. The first collisional contact along the convergent Gondwana\textendash Laurussia plate boundary occurred between Brittany and the Midland microcraton causing the early Devonian deformation along the Anglo-Brabant Fold Belt. This process is coeval with the initiation of continental subduction along the Armorican Spur of the Gondwana plate and the formation of back arc and transtensional basins to both sides of the Armorican Spur (e.g., Lizard, Rheno-Hercynian, Care\'on, Sleza) on the Laurussia plate. As further subduction along this collision zone is blocked, the plate boundary zone between the Gondwana and Laurentia plates is reorganized, leading to a flip of the subduction polarity and a subduction zone jump outboard of the already accreted blocks. The following Devonian\textendash Early Carboniferous subduction accretion process is responsible for the juxtaposition of additional Cadomian blocks against Laurussia and a second suite of high-pressure rocks. The final collision between Gondwana and Laurussia is marked by an intracontinental subduction event affecting the entire internal zone of the orogen. Subduction stopped at 340 Ma and the following isothermal exhumation of the deeply subducted continental crust is primarily responsible for Late Variscan high-temperature metamorphism and cogenetic voluminous granitic magmatism. During this final transpressional stage the irregular shape of the Variscan orogen was established by the highly oblique motion of the decoupled lithospheric blocks (e.g. Iberia and Saxo-Thuringia). Rapid overfilling of synorogenic marine basins in the foreland and subsequent folding of these deposits along vast external fold and thrust belts finally shaped the Variscides, feigning a relatively simple architecture.},

A younger age for the base of the Middle Cambrian results in a younger inferred age of onset of thermal subsidence accompanied by greater rates of subsidence during the Cambrian, whereas a significantly older estimate of the onset of thermal subsidence can be obtained only if the base of the Middle Cambrian is substantially older than 540 Ma, a possibility that is inconsistent with available data.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The late Paleozoic is an important precursor stage in the development of the Mesozoic Cordilleran subduction system along the western margin of North America, but the tectonic history remains ambiguous due to complex overprinting deformation and magmatism. Determining the driving mechanism of large magnitude Permian shortening in southwest Laurentia is critical to understanding the late Paleozoic transition from transform margin to subduction zone. We investigated the driving mechanism of the Permian Last Chance thrust system in east-central California to understand this transition prior to the development of the Mesozoic Cordilleran arc. Here, we present the results of new geological mapping, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, and a synthesis of regional tectonics to inform a kinematic model of the Last Chance thrust system and outline the Permian\textendash Triassic tectonic evolution of the plate boundary during induced subduction initiation. The record of subduction initiation along an inferred late Paleozoic transform fault (the California-Coahuila transform) is preserved by (1) Permian arc magmatism, (2) the onset of volcaniclastic sedimentation, and (3) the development of a regional transpressional system in present-day east-central California. The evolution of this transpressional system and subduction zone is recorded by development of the Last Chance thrust system of the Death Valley region. Geological mapping in the Last Chance Range, northern Death Valley National Park, and the Inyo Mountains reveals the east-directed Last Chance thrust system was constructed by repetitive out-of-sequence deformation consistent with transpressional strain. The Last Chance thrust system accommodated a minimum of \&gt;75 km (60\%) shortening, based on cross-section restorations guided by regional stratigraphic relationships and restoration of subsequent Mesozoic deformation. Our revised model of Jurassic extensional exhumation of the Snow Lake terrane argues the Last chance thrust was not reactivated during the Mesozoic. Large-magnitude shortening along the California-Coahuila transform accommodated a significant component of the convergent plate motion as the Panthalassan crust was thrust below the continental margin before initial slab sinking. Numerical models show the forces resisting subduction are greatest before initial slab sinking takes place, and compression is transmitted in board from the plate boundary. We argue the Last Chance thrust system developed in response to this compression. Early-middle Permian plutons and late Permian detrital zircons in coeval basins suggest subduction was well established by the early Permian. Collectively, the preservation of a thrust system, early arc magmatism, and syntectonic sedimentary basins, which are features typically destroyed by subduction magmatism and deformation, allow for the evaluation of subduction initiation mechanisms based on field observations.},

Presented data constrain a diachrony of Cadomian and related geotectonic processes along the northern realm of the Gondwana Supercontinent. Early stage of Cadomian evolution is characterized by a continental magmatic arc at the periphery of the West African Craton and a related back-arc basin opened at c. 590 to 570 Ma. Diacronic arc\textendash continent collision was caused by oblique vector of subduction and started first in the East of Peri-Gondwana at c. 560\textendash 570 Ma and resulted at c. 543 Ma in the formation of a short-lived Cadomian retro-arc basin in the Saxo-Thuringian Zone. In contrast, more to the West in the Ossa-Morena Zone, the Cadomian back-arc basin was longer active, at least until c. 545 Ma. In that region, final magmatic pulse of the Cadomian magmatic arc at c. 550 Ma is documented by new zircon data. Closure of the Cadomian back-arc basin and arc\textendash continent collision in the Ossa-Morena Zone occurred between c. 545 Ma and the overall onset of Cambrian plutonism at c. 540 Ma. A mid-oceanic ridge was subducted underneath the Cadomian orogen accompanied by slab break-off of the subducted oceanic plate. Oblique incision of the oceanic ridge into the continent caused the formation of rift basins during the Lower to Middle Cambrian (c. 530\textendash 500 Ma). This process continued and finally caused the opening of the Rheic Ocean documented by thick Lower Ordovician siliciclastic sediments and a final magmatic event at c. 490\textendash 485 Ma. Opening of the Cambrian rift basin and of the Rheic Ocean again was diachronic and started from the West of Peri-Gondwana and expanded eastward.},

The simulation predicts that an extensive zone of shallow-dipping subduction extended beyond the flat-lying slab farther east and north by up to 1000 kilometers. The limited region of flat subduction is consistent with the notion that subduction of an oceanic plateau caused the slab to flatten. The results imply that seismic images of the current mantle provide more constraints on past tectonic events than previously recognized.},

Furthermore, regional variations in subsidence rates suggest a possible deficit of negative buoyancy (mantle loading) inside the slab beneath Colorado, supporting the hypothesis that the thickened slab represents a subducted oceanic plateau. This paper documents how the Cretaceous stratigraphy records the timing, patterns, and position of underlying mantle processes during Farallon slab subduction.

  abstract = {The United States Cretaceous Western Interior Basin has long been considered a foreland basin, driven by the Sevier thrust and associated basin sediment loads. However, flexural studies demonstrate that this effect exists only within a narrow band in front of the thrust belt. Most of the basin appears to be due to mantle flow-induced dynamic subsidence associated with Farallon plate subduction. Here we show how the components of evolving long-wavelength dynamic subsidence and flexural subsidence created the accommodation space and controlled the stratigraphy across the western United States, based on a correlated stratigraphic section across central Utah and Colorado. These backstripped subsidence data reveal the dynamic-topography driven nature of the Western Interior Basin. The results seem to support that the depocenters track the trough of dynamic subsidence with ca. 18 Myr cycles through time and space and the stratigraphic patterns of large-scale progradation, eastward migration of depocenter, and regional clinoform-like downlap are related with the dynamic subsidence. Interpretation of these data also provides more insights into the repeated, ca. 2 to 6 Myr cycles of thrust-induced subsidence in front of the thrust belt, which control the local eastward progradation of the sand bodies from the thrust belt. The dynamic, flexural subsidence and eustatic sea level changes interacted and controlled the timing and distribution of unconformities. Our work shows how the stratigraphy precisely records the timing, patterns and position of dynamic versus flexural subsidences, and that combination of such data leads to important geophysical discoveries and supplies strict constraints for geodynamic modeling.},

  abstract = {The Taconic and Salinic orogenies in the northern Appalachian Mountains record the closure of the Iapetus Ocean, which separated peri-Laurentian and peri-Gondwanan terranes in the early Paleozoic. The Taconic orogeny in New England is commonly depicted as an Ordovician collision between the peri-Laurentian Shelburne Falls arc and the Laurentian margin, followed by Silurian accretion of periGondwanan terranes during the Salinic orogeny. New U-Pb zircon geochronology demonstrates that the Shelburne Falls arc was instead constructed on a Gondwanan-derived terrane preserved in the Moretown Formation, which we refer to here as the Moretown terrane. Metasedimentary rocks of the Moretown Formation were deposited after 514 Ma and contain abundant ca. 535\textendash 650 Ma detrital zircon that suggest a Gondwanan source. The Moretown Formation is bound to the west by the peri-Laurentian Rowe belt, which contains detrital zircon in early Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks that is indistinguishable in age from zircon in Laurentian margin rift-drift successions. These data reveal that the principal Iapetan suture in New England is between the Rowe belt and Moretown terrane, more than 50 km farther west than previously suspected. The Moretown terrane is structurally below and west of volcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the Hawley Formation, which contains Laurentian-derived detrital zircon, providing a link between peri-Laurentian and peri-Gondwanan terranes. The Moretown terrane and Hawley Formation were intruded by 475 Ma plutons during peak activity in the Shelburne Falls arc. We propose that the peri-Laurentian Rowe belt was subducted under the Moretown terrane just prior to 475 Ma, when the trench gap was narrow enough to deliver Laurentian detritus to the Hawley Formation. Interaction between peri-Laurentian and peri-Gondwanan terranes by 475 Ma is 20 m.y. earlier than documented elsewhere and accounts for structural relationships, Early Ordovician metamorphism and deformation, and the subsequent closure of the peri-Laurentian Taconic seaway. In this scenario, a rifted-arc system on the Gondwanan margin resulted in the formation of multiple terranes, including the Moretown, that independently crossed and closed the Iapetus Ocean in piecemeal fashion.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Neoproterozoic to Cambrian isolation of Laurentia during the breakup of Rodinia was associated with multiple large igneous provinces, protracted multiphase rifting, and variable subsidence histories along different margin segments. In this contribution, we develop a paleogeographic model for the Neoproterozoic tectonic evolution of Laurentia based on available stratigraphic, paleomagnetic, petrologic, geochronologic, and thermochronologic data. Early Tonian strata are confined to intracontinental basins in northern Laurentia. Breakup of Rodinia around Laurentia began in earnest with emplacement of the ca. 778 Ma Gunbarrel large igneous province, interpreted to have accompanied separation of the North China block along the Yukon promontory, and onset of localized, intracratonic extension southward along the western margin. Eruption of the ca. 760\textendash 740 Ma Mount Rogers volcanic complex along the Southern Appalachian segment of the eastern margin may record extension associated with separation of the Kalahari or South American terranes. At about the same time, the Australia-Mawson blocks began separating from the Sonoran segment of the southern margin and Mojave promontory. Emplacement of the ca. 720 Ma Franklin large igneous province along the northern margin was likely associated with separation of Siberia and was followed by widespread bimodal volcanism and extension along the western margin spanning ca. 720\textendash 670 Ma, leading to partial separation of continental fragments, possibly including Tasmania, Zealandia, and Tarim. Emplacement of the ca. 615 Ma Central Iapetus magmatic province along the eastern margin marked rifting that led to separation of Baltica and Amazonia, and partial separation of the Arequipa-Pampia-Antofalla fragments. During the late Ediacaran to Cambrian, the western, northern, eastern, and southern margins all experienced a second episode of local extension and mafic magmatism, including emplacement of the ca. 585 Ma Grenville dikes and ca. 540\textendash 532 Ma Wichita large igneous province, leading to final separation of continental fragments and Cambrian rift-drift transitions on each margin.             Cryogenian rifting on the western and northern margins and segments of the eastern margin was contemporaneous with low-latitude glaciation. Sturtian and Marinoan glacial deposits and their distinctive ca. 660 Ma and 635 Ma cap carbonates provide important event horizons that are correlated around the western and northern margins. Evidence for Ediacaran glaciation is absent on Laurentia, with the exception of glacial deposits in Scotland, and putative glacial deposits in Virginia, which both formed on the poleward edge of Laurentia. Patterns of exhumation and deposition on the craton display spatial variability, likely controlled by the impingement of mantle plumes associated with mantle upwelling and extensional basin formation during the piecemeal breakup of Rodinia. Glaciation and eustasy were secondary drivers for the distribution of erosion and Neoproterozoic sedimentation on North America.},

  abstract = {Long-term carbon cycle models are critical for understanding the levels and underlying controls of atmospheric CO2 over geological time-scales. We have refined the implementation of two important boundary conditions in carbon cycle models, namely consumption by silicate weathering and carbon degassing. Through the construction of continental flooding maps for the past 520 million years (Myrs), we have estimated exposed land area relative to the present-day (fA), and the fraction of exposed land area undergoing silicate weathering (fAW-fA). The latter is based on the amount of exposed land within the tropics ({$\pm$}10\textdegree ) plus the northern/southern wet belts ({$\pm$}40\textendash 50\textdegree ) relative to today, which are the prime regions for silicate weathering. We also evaluated climate gradients and potential weatherability by examining the distribution of climate-sensitive indicators. This is particularly important during and after Pangea formation, when we reduce fAW-fA during times when arid equatorial regions were present. We also estimated carbon degassing for the past 410 Myrs using the subduction flux from full-plate models as a proxy. We further used the subduction flux to scale and normalize the arc-related zircon age distribution (arc-activity), allowing us to estimate carbon degassing in much deeper time. The effect of these refined modelling parameters for weathering and degassing was then tested in the GEOCARBSULFvolc model, and the results are compared to other carbon cycle models and CO2 proxies. The use of arc-activity as a proxy for carbon degassing brings Mesozoic model estimates closer to CO2 proxy values but our models are highly sensitive to the definition of fAW-fA. Considering only variations in the land availability to weathering that occur in tropical latitudes (corrected for arid regions) and the use of our new degassing estimates leads to notably higher CO2 levels in the Mesozoic, and a better fit with the CO2 proxies.},

  abstract = {The validity of sea level estimates based on stratigraphic correlations has been debated since the 1990 s as relative sea level curves differ between sites due to local tectonics, different deposition rates and changes in dynamic topography. Here, we offer a new eustatic (global) sea level curve for the past 520 million years (Myrs) based on observations of global flooding. We use paleogeographic reconstructions to measure the area of today's exposed land that was flooded in the past (modern-land flooding). We then apply the modern global hypsometric slope to reconstruct the sea level history. We find minimum sea levels (comparable to today's level) towards the end of Pangea (210 Ma) and peak levels (\$280 m higher than today) at 80 Ma when Pangea was widely dispersed. A first-order ``supercontinent'' cycle of 250 million years (Myrs) is recognized but we also document a second-order cycle of 37 Myrs that was previously thought to be undetectable using the hypsometric method. The hypsometric slope is critical for reconstructing past sea levels, and steepening the hypsometric slope during Pangea assembly implies dramatically larger sea level fluctuations. Our new sea level curve shares strong similarities with stratigraphic constraints and correlates with seafloor production proxies throughout the Phanerozoic. Measurements of global flooding represent averages across great continental extents, making them less sensitive than stratigraphic analyses to regional-scale vertical land motion, such as from dynamic topography and hence more reliable for estimating eustatic sea level. This method can also help to identify local deviations caused by regional uplift or subsidence and serves to constrain geodynamic mechanisms for sea level change. Our new sea level reconstruction usefully tracks global variations in Phanerozoic eustatic sea level, but also opens opportunities to estimate such variations in deeper time.},

  abstract = {A major plate reorganization is postulated to have occurred at approximately 100 Ma. However, this reorganization has received limited attention, despite being associated with the most prominent suite of fracture zone bends on the planet and many other geological events. We investigate tectonic events from the period \$ 110 to 90 Ma and show that the reorganization occurred between 105 and 100 Ma, was global in scale, and affected all major plates. Seafloor evidence for plate motion changes is abundant during this period, with either fracture zone bends or terminations preserved in all ocean basins. Long-lived eastern Gondwanaland subduction ended along a 7000 km long section of the margin, while elsewhere around the proto-Pacific rim subduction continued and there is evidence that compressional stresses increased in the overriding plates. Thrusting in western North America, transpression and basin inversion in eastern Asia, and development of the present-day Andean-style margin along western South America occurred contemporaneous with the development of an extensional regime in eastern Gondwanaland. Basin instability in Africa and western Europe further demonstrates that lithospheric stress regime changes were widespread at this time. Considering the timing of the reorganization and the nature of associated plate boundary changes, we suggest that eastern Gondwanaland subduction cessation is the most likely driving mechanism for the reorganization. Subduction is the dominant driver of plate motion and therefore this event had the potential to strongly modify the balance of driving forces acting on the plates in the southwestern proto-Pacific and neighboring plates, whereby producing widespread changes in plate motion and continental lithospheric stress patterns. We propose that major changes in ridge\textendash trench interaction triggered the cessation of subduction. The progressive subduction of two closely spaced perpendicular mid ocean ridges at the eastern Gondwanaland subduction zone, to the east of Australia and New Zealand, respectively, resulted in very young crust entering the trench and we suggest that by 105 \`A 100 Ma there was insufficient negative buoyancy to drive subduction. Finally, we propose that the plume push force of the Bouvet plume, that erupted near the African\textendash Antarctic\textendash South American triple junction, contributed to plate motion changes in the southern Atlantic region.},

  abstract = {The extent of continental rifts and subduction zones through deep geological time provides insights into the mechanisms behind supercontinent cycles and the long term evolution of the mantle. However, previous compilations have stopped short of mapping the locations of rifts and subduction zones continuously since the Neoproterozoic and within a self-consistent plate kinematic framework. Using recently published plate models with continuously closing boundaries for the Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic, we estimate how rift and pericontinental subduction length vary from 1 Ga to present and test hypotheses pertaining to the supercontinent cycle and supercontinent breakup. We extract measures of continental perimeter-to-area ratio as a proxy for the existence of a supercontinent, where during times of supercontinent existence the perimeter-to-area ratio should be low, and during assembly and dispersal it should be high. The amalgamation of Gondwana is clearly represented by changes in the length of peri-continental subduction and the breakup of Rodinia and Pangea by changes in rift lengths. The assembly of Pangea is not clearly defined using plate boundary lengths, likely because its formation resulted from the collision of only two large continents. Instead the assembly of Gondwana (ca. 520 Ma) marks the most prominent change in arc length and perimeter-to-area ratio during the last billion years suggesting that Gondwana during the Early Palaeozoic could explicitly be considered part of a Phanerozoic supercontinent. Consequently, the traditional understanding of the supercontinent cycle, in terms of supercontinent existence for short periods of time before dispersal and re-accretion, may be inadequate to fully describe the cycle. Instead, either a two-stage supercontinent cycle could be a more appropriate concept, or alternatively the time period of 1 to 0 Ga has to be considered as being dominated by supercontinent existence, with brief periods of dispersal and amalgamation.},

  abstract = {Long-term (N10 Myr) fluctuations in climate, sea-level and sedimentation have been documented in the stratigraphic record, but the lack of well-constrained data series has made it difficult to rigorously evaluate cyclic (periodic or quasi-periodic) changes at this scale. Here we utilize a new compilation of the coverage area of sedimentary rocks in North America to investigate the dominant modes (``orders'') of stratigraphic variability, and to evaluate potential long-period cyclic changes in sedimentation on the continent during the Phanerozoic. Our analysis resolves two principal temporal modes of variability: (1) a strongly sinusoidal mode with a periodicity of 56 Myr +/- 3 Myr, and (2) a longer-term Phanerozoic mode (the ``M-curve'', linked to the Wilson cycle), which is indistinguishable from a stochastic autoregressive process. The newly identified 56 Myr cycle in sedimentation delineates most of the cratonic sequences that have previously been identified qualitatively in North America, but here we propose a quantitative redefinition that includes nine distinct units and two mega-sequences. The timing of the 56 Myr beat in sedimentation is consistent with an orogenic oscillator source or an oscillatory dynamic in mantle convection, and its tempo is statistically similar to a known rhythm in number of marine animal genera in the global fossil record. Thus, the identification of a significant periodic signal in the sedimentary record of North America provides new evidence for an important tectonic- and/or mantle-scale cyclic process that links both large-scale biological evolution and physical environmental change.},

We demonstrate, using mantle flow simulations based on high resolution seismic tomography, that both the New Jersey margin and the conjugate western African margin have been subject to orders of 100 m of dynamic (i.e., flow induced) topography change over the last 30 Myr. We also show that the changing pattern of downwelling mantle flow associated with plate subduction is a significant contributor to the background eustatic sea-level trend, which is also of order 100 m during the 30 Myr time window. Therefore, Late-Cenozoic variations of dynamic topography on these passive margin sites are comparable to the eustatic sea-level changes and can partially mask the latter. Furthermore, even if the observed trend could be accurately corrected for local dynamic topography variation, the residual eustatic signal does not merely reflect changes in mean spreading rates at mid-ocean ridges. We conclude that the observed long term sea-level variations at so-called ``stable'' sites cannot be interpreted as eustatic. Moreover, previous analyses that have used long-term sea-level trends as a proxy for spreading rates and geochemical fluxes must be revisited.},

Sm-Nd isotopic analysis of 72 sedimentary rock samples from the Sverdrup Basin, coupled with trace element characterization, shows that for most of Carboniferous to Late Cretaceous time, the sediment supply in the northern part of North America was dominated by a single broad provenance; 56 of the 72 samples lie squarely within the Nd isotopic evolution of a clastic sedimentary cover delivered to the region following 450\textendash 350 Ma Caledonian and Franklinian mountain building in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic Islands. Cratonic Shield sources in Greenland and Canada are hardly evident in the record, and significant contributions to the sediment budget from any source other than the post-mid-Paleozoic orogenic cover occurred only during four relatively short periods. First, during Carboniferous time, pre\textendash Late Ordovician rocks of the Franklinian orogen contributed to alluvial clastic rocks in small rift basins in northern Ellesmere Island. Second, during Early Cretaceous time, Shield basement contributed to more widespread deltaic deposits in central and southern Ellesmere Island. Third, minor volcanic contributions to much of the basin occurred during Late Triassic\textendash earliest Jurassic time and also, fourth, during Late Cretaceous time. Sedimentary materials from Caledonian and Franklinian mountains dominated the provenance of the continental and continent-margin sedimentary system for at least 370 m.yr., a period of time extending far beyond the existence of the mountains themselves. This dominance was achieved by recycling of widespread Middle and Upper Devonian strata into Mesozoic units in the Canadian Arctic and Cordillera. We assess the extent to which the results call for cover of the Greenland-Canadian Shield from 450 to 80 Ma and conclude that while much of the Shield was probably covered by Ordovician to Middle Devonian carbonate units, the northerly derived Upper Devonian clastic sedimentary rocks probably covered about one-half of the Shield in its western and northern portions. This cover was progressively removed through Mesozoic time.},

  abstract = {Rocks in Earth's crust are formed, modified, and destroyed in response to myriad interactions between the solid Earth (tectonics, geodynamics), the fluid Earth (ocean-atmosphere, cryosphere), and the living Earth (evolution, biochemistry). As such, the geological record is an integrator of geological, biological, and climatological processes and their histories. Here we review contrasting perceptions of the processes that govern the formation and destruction of the geological record, beginning with the relationship between macroevolutionary patterns in the fossil and sedimentary rock records and culminating with contrasting models of rock cycling. Using the approach of macrostratigraphy, we present an integrated summary of the quantity-age properties of rocks in continental and oceanic crust. The predominant process signal in the rock quantity-age distribution in continental crust is one of episodic growth, whereas in oceanic crust it is one of continual destruction. Relatively abrupt shifts in the dominant locus of sediment deposition, from fast-cycling oceanic crust to long-term continental reservoirs, and attendant expansions and contractions in the area of crust that is emergent, are correlated in timing and magnitude with shifts in the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere and major macroevolutionary transitions in the biosphere. The most recent of possibly two such first-order transitions occurred at the start of the Phanerozoic and is marked by a prominent preserved geomorphic surface known as the Great Unconformity. {$\blacksquare$} Macrostratigraphy uses the bulk characteristics of the rock record to probe the evolution of the Earth system. {$\blacksquare$} Quantifying the creation and destruction of rock units can illuminate the long-term evolution of continents and the life that inhabits them.

Here we show that the predictions of a model in which the destruction of sedimentary rock is the predominant process signal are borne out only among sediments deposited on oceanic crust and among sediments deposited above sea level in non-marine environments. Most of the surviving volume of sedimentary rock (\textasciitilde 75\%) was deposited in and adjacent to shallow seas on continental crust and does not exhibit any steady decrease in quantity with increasing age. Instead, shallow marine sediments exhibit large fluctuations in quantity that were driven by shifting global tectonic boundary conditions, such as those that occur during the breakup and coalescence of supercontinents. The accumulation of sediments on the continents has not been uniform in rate, but it does record a primary signal of net growth that has many implications for the long-term evolution of Earth's surface environment.},

The preserved sedimentary succession is up to 2500 m thick and consists mainly of Upper Ordovician to Upper Devonian limestones, dolostones, evaporites and minor siliciclastics that were deposited in shallow marine conditions. Backstripping, based on new paleontological data and well correlations, reveals an irregular subsidence history marked by several periods of exhumation. In seismic data, the Hudson Bay Basin appears to have a relatively simple geometry, characterized by a lower sedimentary package cut by high-angle faults, overlain by a saucer-shape, essentially underformed upper sedimentary package. Normal (or transtensional) faults imaged on seismic reflection profiles provide clear evidence for crustal extension during deposition of the older sedimentary packages or slightly later, indicating that the basin is, at least partly, extensional in nature. However, significant changes in the depocenter location during the Paleozoic and variable exhumation values required by new maturation data indicate that other mechanisms influenced the subsidence/exhumation history of the basin. In particular, the influence of far-field events and dynamic topography transmitted by large-scale mantle flow in the continental interior (creating long-wavelength tilting and unconformities) is suspected but not yet proven.},

  abstract = {It is commonly thought that transgressive or regressive events that may have occurred simultaneously on geographically dispersed continental margins have been caused by worldwide sea-level rise or fall, respectively. Instead, it is shown here that these events may be caused by changes in the rates of sea-level rise or fall. The subsidence of an Atlantic-type (passive) margin may be modeled as a bordering platform rotating downward about a landward hinge line. The rate of subsidence is greatest at the seaward side of the platform and decreases landward to zero at the hinge line. With the exception of sea-level changes due to glaciation, dessication, and flooding of small ocean basins and other sudden events, the rate of subsidence at the seaward edge of the platform (shelf edge) is greater than the rate at which sea level may possibly rise or fall. Thus, if sea level is falling, the shoreline will seek that point on the subsiding platform at which the rate of sea-level fall is equal to the rate of subsidence minus the sedimentation rate. If the rate of sea-level fall decreases, the shoreline will move landward; if the rate increases, the shoreline will migrate seaward. If sea level is rising, the shoreline will move to that point where the rate of sea-level rise is equal to the sedimentation rate minus the subsidence rate. Thus, if the rate of sea-level rise decreases, the shoreline will move seaward; if the rate increases, the shoreline will move landward. The position of the shoreline is also a function of the sedimentation rate. These relationships have been quantified so that the position of the shoreline and the thickness of the sediments deposited during discrete time intervals may be computed as a function of the rate of sea-level change and the sedimentation rate. A sea-level curve, based on volume changes of the mid-oceanic ridge system, has been computed. Sea level is seen to fall persistently from Late Cretaceous to middle Miocene time, but transgressions occur in Eocene and early Miocene time because the rate of sea-level fall is slower for these periods. It is concluded also that the presence of the shoreline seaward of the shelf edge of an Atlantic margin should be symptomatic of events that may cause rapid sea-level fall, such as glacial build-up or the sudden flooding of large deep basins.},

Strata in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, for example, record flooding events that reached deep into the interior of the continent during the Devonian to Carboniferous. The epeirogenic motion which caused this deposition was contemporaneous with compressive tectonic events along the western plate margin of Laurussia. We propose that the long-wavelength component of inferred subsidence and uplift across the basin was the result of mantle flow-induced dynamic topography. In particular, we investigate the epeirogenic signals associated with the coupled mantle processes of near-surface subduction and later stage penetration of accumulated slab material through the endothermic phase change at 660 km depth. Numerical simulations of convection are presented to model the thermo-mechanical evolution of subduction in the mantle. The associated dynamic topography is initially characterized by tilting of the continental margin and submergence approximately 1000 km from the trench due to viscous effects associated with the subduction. A more extensive transgression onto the continental platform follows as accumulating slab material penetrates through the endothermic phase change. We argue that the predicted subsidence and uplift is broadly consistent with the inferred record of DevonianCarboniferous epeirogeny across western Canada, and thus that the evolution of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin may be intimately connected to mantle flow processes occurring contemporaneously beneath the craton.},

  abstract = {Half-space cooling and plate models of varying complexity have been proposed to account for changes in basement depth and heat flow as a function of lithospheric age in the oceanic realm. Here, we revisit this well-known problem by exploiting a revised and augmented database of 2,028 measurements of depth to oceanic basement, corrected for sedimentary loading and variable crustal thickness, and 3,597 corrected heat flow measurements. Joint inverse modeling of both databases shows that the half-space cooling model yields a mid-oceanic axial temperature that is {$>$} 100{$\circ$}C hotter than permitted by petrologic constraints. It also fails to produce the observed flattening at old ages. Then, we investigate a suite of increasingly complex plate models and conclude that the optimal model requires incorporation of experimentally determined temperature- and pressure-dependent conductivity, expansivity, and specific heat capacity, as well as a low-conductivity crustal layer. This revised model has a mantle potential temperature of 1300 {$\pm$} 50{$\circ$}C, which honors independent geochemical constraints and has an initial ridge depth of 2.6 {$\pm$} 0.3 km with a plate thickness of 135 {$\pm$} 30 km. It predicts that the maximum depth of intraplate earthquakes is bounded by the 700{$\circ$}C isothermal contour, consistent with laboratory creep experiments on olivine aggregates. Estimates of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary derived from studies of azimuthal anisotropy coincide with the 1175 {$\pm$} 50{$\circ$}C isotherm. The model can be used to isolate residual depth and gravity anomalies generated by flexural and sub-plate convective processes.},

  abstract = {On a spherical Earth, the mean elevation (approximately 22440 m) would be everywhere at a mean Earth radius from the center. This directly links an elevation at the surface to physical dimensions of Earth, including surface area and volume, which are at most very slowly evolving components of the Earth system. Earth's mean elevation thus provides a framework within which to consider changes in height of Earth's solid surface as a function of time. In this article, the focus will be on long-term, nonglacially controlled sea level. Long-term sea level has long been argued to be largely controlled by changes in ocean basin volume related to changes in the area-age distribution of oceanic lithosphere. As generally modeled by Walter Pitman and subsequent workers, the age-depth relationship of oceanic lithosphere, including both the ridge depth and the coefficients describing the age-depth relationship, are assumed constant. This article examines the consequences of adhering to these assumptions when placed within the larger framework of maintaining a constant mean radius of Earth. Self-consistent estimates of long-term sea level height and changes in the mean depth of the oceanic crust are derived from the assumption that the mean elevation and corresponding mean radius are unchanging aspects of Earth's shorter-term evolution. Within this context, changes in the mean depth of the oceanic crust, corresponding with changes in the mean age of oceanic lithosphere, acting over the area of the oceanic crust represent a volume change that is required to be balanced by a compensating equal but opposite volume change under the area of the continental crust. Models of cumulative paleohypsometry derived from a starting glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA)\textendash corrected ice-free hypsometry that conserve mean elevation provide a basis for understanding how these compensating changes impact global hypsometry and particularly estimates of global mean shoreline height. Paleoshoreline height and areal extent of flooding can be defined as the height and corresponding cumulative area of the solid surface of Earth at which the integral of area as a function of elevation, from the maximum depth upward, equals the volume of ocean water filling it with respect to cumulative paleohypsometry. The present height of the paleoshoreline is the height on the GIA-corrected cumulative hypsometry at an area equal to the areal extent of flooding. Paleogeographic estimates of the global extent of ocean flooding from the Middle Jurassic to end Eocene, when combined with conservation of mean elevation and ocean water volume, allow an explicit estimate of the paleoheight and the present height of the paleoshoreline. The best-fitting estimate of the present height of the paleoshoreline, equivalent to a long-term ``eustatic'' sea level curve, implies very modest (25 5 22 m) changes in long-term sea level above the ice-free sea level height of approximately 140 m. These, in turn, imply quite limited changes in the mean depth of the oceanic crust (15 5 11 m) and in the mean age of the oceanic lithosphere ({$\sim$}62.1 5 2.4 My) since the Middle Jurassic.},

We evaluate the spatial and temporal evolution of Earth's long-wavelength surface dynamic topography since the Jurassic using a series of high-resolution global mantle convection models. These models are Earth-like in terms of convective vigour, thermal structure, surface heat-flux and the geographic distribution of heterogeneity. The models generate a degree-2-dominated spectrum of dynamic topography with negative amplitudes above subducted slabs (i.e. circum-Pacific regions and southern Eurasia) and positive amplitudes elsewhere (i.e. Africa, north-western Eurasia and the central Pacific). Model predictions are compared with published observations and subsidence patterns from well data, both globally and for the Australian and southern African regions. We find that our models reproduce the long-wavelength component of these observations, although observed smaller-scale variations are not reproduced. We subsequently define geodynamic rules for how different surface tectonic settings are affected by mantle processes: (i)~locations in the vicinity of a subduction zone show large negative dynamic topography amplitudes; (ii)~regions far away from convergent margins feature long-term positive dynamic topography; and (iii)~rapid variations in dynamic support occur along the margins of overriding plates (e.g. the western US) and at points located on a plate that rapidly approaches a subduction zone (e.g. India and the Arabia Peninsula). Our models provide a predictive quantitative framework linking mantle convection with plate tectonics and sedimentary basin evolution, thus improving our understanding of how subduction and mantle convection affect the spatio-temporal evolution of basin architecture.},

Rift-related igneous and sedimentary assemblages dated at ca. 1.5, 1.38, and 1.2 to 1.0 Ga correlate across the reconstructed Siberia-Laurentia rift zone. Renewed rifting in the Neoproterozoic and Vendian culminated with seafloor spreading and thermal subsidence of the conjugate rift shoulders.

Contrary to conventional wisdom in the areas they occupy, evolution of the Saharides involved no continental collisions until the end of their development.

The Sahara appears to be underlain by a double orocline similar to the Hercynian double orocline in western Europe and northwestern Africa and not by an hypothetical ``Saharan Metacraton.''

The data they presented were highly convincing, yet they were unable to explain what process might have generated this pattern. A significant correlation between observed genus-level diversity (after removal of long-term trends) and the amount of marine sedimentary rock measured at a surface outcrop in Western Europe is demonstrated. This suggests that cyclicity originates from long-term changes in sedimentary depositional and erosional regimes, and raises the strong possibility that the cyclicity apparent in the record of marine fossils is not a biological signal but a sampling signal.},

Of these plutons, 75\% are metaluminous biotite or amphibole + biotite granitoids with lower crustal sources, and 20\% are peraluminous biotite + muscovite {$\pm$} garnet or cordierite + biotite granitoids with more evolved crustal sources. The remaining 5\% are gabbroids, intermediate rocks, and possible alkaline granitoids. The granitoid to gabbroid + intermediate rock area ratio is 180:1. The exposed intrusive rocks were produced at a relatively slow rate of 2 kmin3/ linear km/m.y. along the orogen, indicating an inability of the source to produce much melt, inefficient melting mechanisms, or difficulty of magma segregation and ascent. The absence of spatial trends in rock composition and age of emplacement, the small amount but relative abundance of the granitoids, and coincidence with contemporaneous strike-slip faults favor deformation-driven granitoid magma generation, segregation, and ascent. Melting occurred by juxtaposition of high-temperature rocks against lower-temperature melting rocks, decompression, fluxing, or a combination of these as a result of either transpressional arching or faulting. The magmas separated from their source by dilatancy pumping into active shear zones. Energy considerations favor magma ascent by conduit flow in the fault zones with separate magmas pulses channelled into and up the same preheated pathways, resulting in the common occurrence of composite plutons. Emplacement was confined to areas of extension or least compression in faults and folds. Plutons away from shear zones were probably emplaced in their final stages by ductile ballooning. Increasing viscosity with progressive crystallization stopped magma ascent at 8-20 km depths, though the heat of crystallization locally softened the wall rocks and allowed final ductile magma ascent and emplacement in the brittle crust. Segregation, ascent, emplacement, crystallization, and cooling for each magma center was rapid.},

As a result, the Cambrian tectonic evolution of the region is poorly understood. We present here a revised lithostratigraphic section from the late Early to Mid-Cambrian rocks exposed near Stawell in western Victoria, which is used as the basis for correlating geological events in East Gondwana. These data show that the Cambrian tectonic evolution of East Gondwana's .4000 km long proto-Pacific margin involved predominantly compressional orogenesis separated by major short-lived extensional events at c. 516\textendash 514 and 504\textendash 500 Ma. The most significant extensional event, at c. 516\textendash 514 Ma, involved extensive slab rollback along the proto-Pacific margin in response to major changes in global plate motions and plate-boundary stresses following the termination of East\textendash West Gondwana collision. Partial subduction of a ribbon of buoyant continental crust led to localized subduction-zone failure and obduction of the young hot forearc lithosphere in Tasmania at c. 510 Ma. Collision of the continental ribbon also significantly modified the architecture of the proto-Pacific margin and ultimately controlled the extent of the second major extensional event associated with slab rollback at c. 504\textendash 500 Ma. Tectonic evolution of the proto-Pacific margin of East Gondwana thus involved the complex interaction between convergent-margin processes and collisional orogenesis.},

  abstract = {In the humid tropics, the primary factor which distinguishes different weathering regimes is tectonic setting, especially the contrast between tectonically active areas and stable cratonic regions. In tectonically active environmen ts, most of the material that is exposed to weathering has undergone rapid uplift involving brittle deformation, and volcanism is sometimes important. Uplift rates are on the order of 103\_104 mm/ka, while erosion rates are about the same to an order of magnitude less. As a result, easily weathered lithologies are exposed on steep slopes and weathering rates are lithology dependent. Where carbonates and evaporites are present, their weathering products dominate the river solution chemistry. Similarly, weakly cemented clastic rocks dominate solid load inputs. Aluminosilicate rocks do not weather completely to phases depleted in the major cations (Na, K, Mg, Ca); instead, some unweathered primary minerals remain, and various secondary cation-rich clays frequently form. On the cratons, sea level changes exert a major control on long term weathering rates and landscape development. When sea level is high, sediment is deposited on the passive margins, continental platforms, and intracratonic basins. At the same time near-sea-level planation surfaces develop on shield areas. As sea level drops erosion is not regionally uniform, but is localized on scarps which advance into the older erosion surfaces. For South American shields average uplift rates approach 10-20 mm/ka, and it seems reasonable that their long-term average erosion rates are close to this value. Weathering on the craton is much more complete, and the solid weathering products are cation depleted: quartz, kaolinite, and sesquioxides. After cyclic salt corrections, major cations in rivers are in bedrock proportions.},

  abstract = {The uplift of the southern African Plateau with its average elevations of {$\sim$}1,000 m is often attributed to mantle processes, but there are conflicting theories for the timing and drivers of topographic development. Evidence for most proposed plateau development histories is derived from continental erosion histories, marine stratigraphic architecture, or landscape morphology. Here we use a landscape evolution model to integrate a large data set of low-temperature thermochronometry, sediment flux rates to surrounding marine basins, and current topography for southern Africa. We explore three main hypotheses for surface uplift: (a) southern Africa was already elevated by the Early Cretaceous before Gondwana breakup, (b) uplift and continental tilting occurred during the mid-Cretaceous, or (c) uplift occurred during the mid to late Cenozoic. We test which of these three intervals of plateau development are plausible by using an inversion method to constrain the range in erosional and uplift model parameters that can best reproduce the observed data. Results indicate four regions of parameter space that fall into two families of uplift histories are most compatible with the data. Both uplift families have limited initial topography with some topographic uplift and continental tilting starting at {$\sim$}90\textendash 100 Ma. In one acceptable scenario, nearly all of the topography, {$>$}1,300 m, is created at this time with little Cenozoic uplift. In the other acceptable scenario, {$\sim$}400\textendash 800 m of uplift occurs in the mid-Cretaceous with another {$\sim$}500\textendash 1,000 m of uplift in the mid-Cenozoic. The two model scenarios have different geodynamic implications, which we compare to geodynamic models.},

The causes and implications of this feature, and whether it represents a singular global event, are much debated. Here, we present new apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe) thermochronologic data from the central Canadian Shield that constrain when the Precambrian basement last cooled to near-surface temperatures, likely via exhumation, before deposition of overlying early Paleozoic sedimentary sequences that mark the Great Unconformity. AHe data from 11 samples (n = 57) across a broad region define a similar date-eU pattern, implying a common thermal history. Higher eU ({$>$}25 ppm) apatite form distinct flat profiles of reproducible dates at {$\sim$}510 {$\pm$} 49 Ma (mean and 1{$\sigma$} standard deviation), while lower eU ({$<$}25 ppm) apatite define a positive date-eU trend with younger dates. The data patterns, geologic context, and thermal history modeling point toward {$>$}3 km of erosion across the entire {$\sim$}450,000 km2 study area between 650 and 440 Ma, followed by modest reheating during later burial. Plume activity associated with intracratonic basin formation or continental rifting/breakup may have caused this erosion event. The post-650 Ma timing of the last major sub-Great Unconformity exhumation phase in this region implies a late Great Unconformity that is younger than inferred elsewhere in North America. This suggests that this feature is likely the result of multiple temporally distinct erosion events with differing footprints and mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Southwestern Laurentia experienced intraplate deformation during the Pennsylvanian and early Permian, an orogenic event termed the Ancestral Rocky Mountains (ARM). Deformation consisted of uplifted Precambriancored basement blocks separated from adjacent basins by high-angle faults. The tectonic drivers of this orogen are debated, which is likely in part due to significant changes to the chronostratigraphy of the geologic time scale since many of the models have been proposed. To better understand the orogen, we assess spatial subsidence patterns with 1-D backstripped tectonic subsidence curves from eight ARM basins across the orogen using the 2020 Geologic Time Scale for temporal calibration. These patterns indicate the following: 1) basins largely initiated in the late Morrowan\textemdash early Atokan (Bashkirian); 2) most subsidence curves suggest flexure from a fixed-load foreland basin that steadily increased until the Missourian (Kasimovian) where most basins reached peak subsidence; 3) diminished subsidence occurred in most basins in the Late Pennsylvanian and shut off across most of the orogen by the end of the Wolfcampian (Asselian\textemdash early Artinskian); and 4) basin subsidence renewed in the southern basins during the Leonardian (late Artinskian\textemdash Kungurian). The synchronous start to basin subsidence is coeval to the initiation of highly oblique convergence between the Laurentia and Panthalassan plates along the southwestern margin. Influences from the Ouachita-Marathon margin are best reflected by Late Mississippian subsidence of the Anadarko Basin and transpressional deformation in the Orogrande Basin during the Late Pennsylvanian. The decrease in early Permian subsidence is coeval to the cessation of movement on most ARM faults and burial of Precambrian-cored highlands indicating that classical ARM tectonics is mostly a Pennsylvanian event. The increase in subsidence observed during the Leonardian (late Artinskian\textemdash Kungurian) in the southern basins may reflect renewed oblique convergence along the southwestern margin.},

These observations are predominantly from areas with sparse sedimentary cover, which are unperturbed by crustal thickening and by regional epeirogeny. Few such measurements are available from old oceanic lithosphere where sediment thickness is large. In order to address this omission, we have analyzed a legacy dataset of seismic reflection and wide-angle profiles from the margins of the Atlantic Ocean. Our aims are twofold. First, we determine the isostatically corrected age\textendash depth variation of old oceanic lithosphere adjacent to continental margins and compare it with existing trends. Secondly, we isolate residual depth anomalies and compare them with dynamic topographic predictions made from longwavelength gravity anomalies. Within the sedimentary pile, we have used a suite of coincident seismic reflection and wide-angle measurements to create a method for converting two-way travel time into depth and sediment density. We also correct for changes in oceanic crustal thickness. On the oldest portions of the Atlantic Ocean, the corrected age\textendash depth variation is consistent with results from the Pacific Ocean, which suggests that the oceanic plate has a thickness of 90\textendash 95 km. Positive and negative deviations from the global age\textendash depth trend are common and can be as large as {$\pm$} 1 km. They mostly (but not always) correlate with long-wavelength gravity anomalies if the admittance is \textasciitilde{} 30 mGal km- 1. We propose that these deviations are primarily generated by convective circulation within the upper mantle.},

About halfway through the sequence, the Shuram negative carbon isotopic excursion occurs within the Rainstorm Member near the top of the Johnnie Formation, followed by a remarkable valley incision event. At its type locality in the northwest Spring Mountains, Nevada, the Johnnie lithostratigraphy consists of three distinctive sand-rich intervals alternating with four siltstone/carbonate-rich intervals, which appear correlative with other regional \-Johnnie Formation outcrops. Carbon isotope ratios in the sub\textendash Rainstorm Member part of the Johnnie Formation are uniformly positive for at least 400 m below the Shuram excursion and compare well with sub\textendash Shuram excursion profiles from the \-Khufai Formation in Oman. There is historical consensus that the Johnnie and overlying formations were deposited on a thermally subsiding passive margin. Following previous authors, we used Paleozoic horizons of known biostratigraphic age to define a time-dependent exponential subs\- idence model, and extrapolated the model back in time to estimate the ages of the Shuram excursion and other prominent Ediacaran horizons. The model suggests that the Shuram excursion occurred from 585 to 579 Ma, and that incision of the Rainstorm Member shelf occurred during the 579 Ma Gaskiers glaciation. It further suggests that the base of the Johnnie Formation is ca. 630 Ma, consistent with the underlying Noonday Formation representing a Marinoan cap carbonate sequence. Our results contrast with suggestions by previous workers that the Shuram excursion followed the Gaskiers event by some 20\textendash 30 m.y. We suggest instead that the Shuram and Gaskiers events were contemporaneous with the biostratigraphic transition from acantho\-morphic to leiospherid acritarchs, and with the first appearance of widespread macroscopic animal life, 38 m.y. prior to the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary.},

  abstract = {Long-term variations in eustatic sea level in an ice-free world, which existed through most of the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic eras, are partly driven by changes in the volume of ocean basins. Previous studies have determined ocean basin volume changes from plate tectonic reconstructions since the Mesozoic; however, these studies have not considered a number of important elements that contribute to ocean basin volume, such as regional differences in sedimentation, or uncertainties within the plate tectonic model itself, such as spreading asymmetries and the incomplete representation of back-arc basins in the Mesozoic. Additionally, studies on longterm changes in sea level related to the extension and rifting of passive margins have not been performed on a global-scale and likely significantly underestimated the influence of this process. In order to improve reconstructions of sea level on geologic time scales and assess the uncertainty in deriving the volume of ocean basins based on a global plate kinematic model, we investigate the influence of back-arc basins, spreading asymmetry, large igneous provinces (LIPs), sediment thickness, and passive margins on ocean basin volume since 200 Ma. We find that less-constrained plate tectonic elements, such as the presence of back-arc basins or spreading asymmetry, may contribute up to \textasciitilde 120 m or \textasciitilde 150 m to sea level respectively. Changes in the sea level related to sedimentation and LIPs are respectively \textasciitilde 75\textendash 165 m and \textasciitilde 45 m. Changes in sea level associated with passive margin formation are almost negligible at present day, though were much larger in the Cretaceous, and the assumed sedimentation style strongly influences the rate and magnitude of sea-level change. We incorporate predictions for these components during times where ocean basins are predominantly synthetic reconstructions and find that sea level driven by fluctuating ocean basin volume has changed by \textasciitilde 200 m since the Jurassic, which is comparable to previous estimates. Our revised estimates will need to be combined with other processes driving long-term sea-level change, including mantle convection-driven dynamic topography and glacio-eustasy for constructing a complete eustatic sea-level curve. Understanding and quantifying the uncertainties in the volume of ocean basins has implications for modelling subduction flux, the oceanic carbon cycle, and heatflow, and is important for exploring Earth's evolutionary cycles, especially during times in the geologic past where much of the ocean basin history has been lost.},

  abstract = {The thin-skin Sevier and thick-skin Laramide belts of the North American Cordillera provide a long-term record of the interrelations between evolving styles of mountain building and plate dynamics over a complete tectonic cycle, from onset of rapid subduction, to protracted growth of a composite orogenic system, to final collapse. Primary architecture of basement and sedimentary cover rocks, which included a thick passive margin section deposited along the western continental margin, influenced patterns of subsequent deformation. The Cordilleran orogenic system, comprised of an interrelated forearc accretionary complex, magmatic arc, retroarc hinterland, Sevier fold-thrust belt, and foreland basin locally deformed by Laramide arches, developed during Jurassic to Paleogene Andean-style subduction and terrane accretion. The Sevier belt formed as a foreland-propagating (west to east) wedge mostly during Cretaceous to Paleogene time, and included a western thrust system with aerially extensive thrust sheets that carried thick passive margin strata, and an eastern thrust system that carried thinner strata. Within the Wyoming salient of the Sevier belt, major thrust and fold traces display systematic map-view curvature about an average N\textendash S structural trend, reflecting a component of primary curvature related to sedimentary prism architecture, followed by 60\textendash 80\% vertical-axis rotation of thrust sheets related to curved fault slip and interaction with Laramide arches at the salient ends. Internal deformation in the western thrust sheets was limited within strong shallower levels, whereas deeper levels underwent shear and vertical flattening near a weak basal fault zone. Internal deformation in the eastern thrust sheets included widespread early layerparallel shortening (LPS), followed by concentration of slip onto weak fault zones. Approximately 200 km of thinskin shortening in the Sevier belt was transferred into lower crustal thickening and uplift of an orogenic plateau in the hinterland to the west. Synorogenic strata were deposited in an evolving foreland basin to the east that formed during flexural loading of thrust sheets and regional dynamic subsidence during subduction. Overall E-oriented shortening in the Sevier belt is interpreted to reflect increased gravitational potential energy and evolving topographic slopes from a hinterland plateau through a growing thrust wedge. Laramide basementcored arches and intervening basins developed during later Cretaceous to Paleogene time, overlapping with younger stages of Sevier deformation. Arches and associated reverse faults display a wide range of trends within an overall NW\textendash SE oriented, anastomosing network, partly reflecting primary basement heterogeneities. Limited vertical-axis rotations were localized along obliquely trending arch forelimbs and near arch intersections. Internal deformation in the foreland included limited LPS that refracted near variably trending arches. Laramide deformation was spatially and temporally correlated with a region of flat-slab subduction, recorded by changes in magmatic and subsidence patterns. Overall ENE-oriented shortening in the Laramide belt was at low angles to relative plate motion, likely reflecting increased plate coupling near a cratonic lithosphere keel. An integrated model for tectonic evolution of the Sevier and Laramide belts includes: influence of primary sedimentary architecture and basement weaknesses; enhanced plate coupling from increased overriding plate motion, fast convergence rates, and development of a flat-slab segment; linkage of upper crustal shortening in the Sevier belt with lower crustal thickening and uplift of a hinterland plateau; interaction between frontal thrusts in the Sevier belt and Laramide arches with differently oriented stress fields; concentrated slip along weak fault zones; redistribution of mass by erosion and deposition of synorogenic strata; and a switch to orogenic collapse during decreased convergence rates and slab removal.},

  abstract = {Dynamic topography at the Earth's surface caused by mantle convection can affect a range of geophysical and geological observations including bathymetry, sea-level change, continental flooding, sedimentation and erosion. These observations provide important constraints on and test of mantle dynamic models. Based on global mantle convection models coupled with the surface plate motion history, we compute dynamic topography and its history for the last 400 Ma associated with Pangea assembly and breakup, with particular focus on cratonic regions. We propose that burial-unroofing histories of cratons inferred from thermochronology data can be used as a new diagnostic to test dynamic topography and mantle dynamic models. Our models show that there are currently two broad dynamic topography highs in the Pacific and Africa for the present-day Earth that are associated with the broad, warm structures (i.e., superplumes) in the deep mantle, consistent with previous proposals of dynamical support for the Pacific and African superswells. Our models reveal that Pangea assembly and breakup, by affecting subduction and mantle upwelling processes, have significant effects on continental vertical motions. Our models predict that the Slave craton in North America subsides before Pangea assembly at 330 Ma but uplifts significantly from 330 Ma to 240 Ma in response to pre-Pangea subduction and post-assembly mantle warming. The Kaapvaal craton of Africa is predicted to undergo uplift from \textasciitilde 180 Ma to 90 Ma after Pangea breakup, but its dynamic topography remains stable for the last 90 Ma. The predicted histories of elevation change for the Slave and Kaapvaal cratons compare well with the burial-unroofing histories inferred from thermochronology studies, thus supporting our dynamic models including the development of the African superplume mantle structure. The vertical motion histories for other cratons can provide further tests of and constraints on our mantle dynamic models. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {We show in this paper that mobile-lid mantle convection in a three-dimensional spherical shell with observationally constrained mantle viscosity structure, and realistic convective vigor and internal heating rate is characterized by either a spherical harmonic degree-1 planform with a major upwelling in one hemisphere and a major downwelling in the other hemisphere when continents are absent, or a degree-2 planform with two antipodal major upwellings when a supercontinent is present. We propose that due to modulation of continents, these two modes of mantle convection alternate within the Earth's mantle, causing the cyclic processes of assembly and breakup of supercontinents including Rodinia and Pangea in the last 1 Ga. Our model suggests that the largely degree-2 structure for the present-day mantle with the Africa and Pacific antipodal superplumes, is a natural consequence of this dynamic process of very long-wavelength mantle convection interacting with supercontinent Pangea. Our model explains the basic features of true polar wander (TPW) events for Rodinia and Pangea including their equatorial locations and large variability of TPW inferred from paleomagnetic studies. Our model also suggests that TPW is expected to be more variable and large during supercontinent assembly, but small after a supercontinent acquires its equatorial location and during its subsequent dispersal.},

We have formulated 3-D models of mantle convection to investigate the effects of plume\^plate interactions on surface vertical motions and swell topography. In our models, the controlling parameters are plume radius, excess plume temperature, and upper mantle viscosity. We have found that swell height and swell width constraints limit the radius of the Hawaiian plume to be smaller than 70 km. The additional constraint from the uplift at Lanai requires excess plume temperature to be greater than 400 K. If excess plume temperature is 400 K, models with plume radius between 50 and 70 km and upper mantle viscosity between 1020 and 3U1020 Pa s satisfy all the constraints. Our results indicate that mantle plume in the upper mantle may be significantly hotter than previously suggested. This has important implications for mantle convection and mantle melting. In addition to constraining plume dynamics, our models also provide a mechanism to produce the observed uplift at Lanai and Molokai that has never been satisfactorily explained before.},

These rocks form a bimodal volcanic suite consisting mainly of silicic metavolcanic rocks with subordinate metabasalts. Five silicic metavolcanic samples dated at ca. 492 Ma and one metabasalt sample yielding a near-concordant 206Pb/238U age of 492 {$\pm$} 4 Ma indicate that mafic and silicic eruptions were contemporaneous. The metabasalts are mostly high-K calc-alkaline, enriched in Th, U, and light rare earth elements (LREEs), and depleted in Nb, Ta, Ti, Zr, and Hf, geochemically resembling the Andean arc basalts. The silicic metavolcanic rocks are high-K calc-alkaline and low in Nb and Zr. The metabasaltic rocks have negative whole-rock {$\epsilon$}Nd(t) values (- 4.7 to - 3.5) and varying zircon {$\epsilon$}Hf(t) values (- 0.7 to + 7.5), differing significantly from those of the silicic metavolcanic rocks, which yield negative whole-rock {$\epsilon$}Nd(t) values of - 8.4 to - 7.2 and varying zircon {$\epsilon$}Hf(t) values (- 13.9 to - 4.6). The metabasaltic rocks are interpreted as resulting from partial melting of an enriched lithospheric mantle source that was metasomatized by subduction-related components, whereas the silicic metavolcanic rocks were derived from basaltic melt-induced anatexis of the ancient Lhasa basement with inherited mantle melt signatures. The Western Qiangtang\textendash Amdo\textendash Tethyan Himalaya situated in the Indian proto-Tethyan margin and the Lhasa and other possible microcontinents or terranes (e.g., Gongshan, Baoshan, Tengchong, Burma, and Sibumasu) paleographically located in the Australian proto-Tethyan margin represent an early Paleozoic Andean-type magmatic arc facing the proto-Tethyan Ocean. The emplacement of the bimodal volcanic rocks and the development of the Cambro\textendash Ordovician angular unconformity in the central Lhasa subterrane can be attributed to slab break-off of the proto-Tethyan Ocean lithosphere following the collisional accretion of microcontinents or terranes located outboard of the magmatic arc (possibly Eastern Qiangtang and South China).},

A variety of environmental perturbations have been correlated to this rapid animal species diversification1-3. Increased weathering fluxes from the continents to the oceans are hypothesized to cause these perturbations4-6, but why such enhanced weathering occurred is unknown. We document two newly discovered eclogite occurrences within the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). These eclogites recorded Cambrian deep subduction of continental crust and consequent mountain building during arc-continent collisions concomitant to the Cambrian Explosion. Correlative metamorphic belts of the same age occur across the CAOB indicating a continental subduction front ({$>$}3,500 km) larger than that of the modern Himalaya. The CAOB, along with Gondwana's peripheral orogens, provide a unique and unrecognized global accretionary orogen ({$>$}18,500 km) for the Cambrian Earth, larger than the so-far recognized Cambrian collisional orogen during Gondwana assembly4. Our biogeochemical modelling results suggest that the increased weathering of phosphorus from these accretionary orogenic belts would stimulate marine primary productivity, increase atmospheric O2, and promote the expansion of shallow-ocean oxygenation at a time coincident with the Cambrian Explosion.},
